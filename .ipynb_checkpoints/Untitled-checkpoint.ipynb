After 3 months the Ram was causing the computer to get the BSOD. Since I had to wait for my son to bring down his computer from his mother's house in a different State, at the 6 months mark I pulled the Ram and re-installed the original Ram and the BSOD of disappeared. So I put in a request to have the Ram replaced, since I bought the brand new sealed Ram off an Ebay seller and not an approved stockist, Corsair will not honour the warranty.

Been two weeks, No reply's no help until I am forced to seek a charge back.  At one time they were the best and most caring.

Very quickly you will discover the apathy, ignorance and dismissiveness that so many have experienced.In a series of emails and messages exchanged with Corsair, where I clearly articulated a few technical questions the agent(s) and even team leader opt to ignore said questions and usually reply answering a question I never asked.To say this is frustrating is such an understatement, no less so when I’ve spent 4 figures on their products.Date of experience: February 22, 2024\n",

The build guide on their site isn't thorough enough and glossed over many steps or just didn't even tell me what to do.
