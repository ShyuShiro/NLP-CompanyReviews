Project by Brandon Tran
May 2024
Purpose: To expand my knowledge into NLP and cement my experience in webscrape/BeautifulSoup while incorporating my experience in Tableau to create interactive visualizations.

## Code is available and quite easily adaptable if you wanted to check the reviews of another company **
1. Download jupyter notebook
2. Install the necessary packages (BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Pandas, Numpy, etc)
3. Change the URL from Trustpilot for Corsair to Trustpilot for XYZ company
4. Execute code blocks

Code in its current state is set up more like a documentation of my journey through this project. Will update in the future given time to make this code more stand-alone and directly execute the necessary functions to generate the same output.
