Jeg forsøgte at få hjælp fra deres supportteam, men de har slet ikke været hjælpsomme. De vil ikke besvare mine spørgsmål om garantien eller hjælpe mig med at få disken til at fungere. Det er den værste kundeservice, jeg nogensinde har oplevet.For at gøre tingene værre, nægtede de at overholde min garanti, fordi jeg fjernede et klistermærke. På deres eget forum anbefalede en Corsair-medarbejder at fjerne dette klistermærke, hvis man installerer SSD'en med en heat sink, hvilket er præcis, hvad jeg gjorde. Det giver ikke mening, at de vil fortælle dig en ting på deres forum og så nægte at hjælpe, når du følger deres råd.Jeg er virkelig skuffet over Corsair. Jeg kan ikke komme videre med en ikke fungerende SSD, og de ser ud til at være ligeglade. Jeg ønsker, at andre skal vide om dette, før de køber fra Corsair. Der skal virkelig rettes op på kundeservicen og de skal afholde loven, hvad angår garanti.Hold dig langt væk fra Corsair, hvis du ikke vil gentage min oplevelse!---I bought a Corsair SSD, and it didn't work right from the start.

On their own forum, a Corsair employee recommended removing this sticker if you're installing the SSD with a heat sink, which is exactly what I did. It doesn't make sense that they'd tell you to do something on their forum and then refuse to help when you follow their advice.I'm really disappointed with Corsair. I'm stuck with a broken SSD, and they don't seem to care at all. I want other people to know about this before they buy from Corsair.

With my colorimeter device I measured 905:1 contrast ratio in the center, which comes a bit close to the advertised 1000:1, but slightly off center, I measure 723:1, and even much lower the closer I measured to the edges. This is just unacceptable. (And it doesn't matter what monitor settings I choose, it stays like this.)I read online some reviews that also remarked about the significant lack of contrast. At the time when considering the purchase (my bad), I shoved it aside, letting my judgement be clouded by thinking it wouldn't be such an issue, as the reviews do mention great color accuracy. And indeed, with my colorimeter I measured 100% sRGB & AdobeRGB, and 93% DCI-P3 gamut coverage, and spot on gamma 2.2 black transition, which is nice for photo editing.However, videocontent/games are just unwatchable. My friend said, it's like you look through a 'tunnel' of glare, and can only see the content a bit comfortable in the middle of the screen, if you sit straight in front of the monitor. I mean, it's like going back to the early 2000s. Even my IPS panel, BenQ GW2765HE from over 8 years ago seems to have way less glare. I mean, of course I understand a bit of washed out look is just a side effect of IPS panels, compared to OLED (that has the downside of being more prone to burn-in), but the extend to how washed out it is, is just too significant. These days IPS panels should be able to have a 1000:1 contrast ratio.The 16 local dimming zones don't help either with dark scenes, as the pixels in these areas seem to need to be displaying a solid black color, in order for the dimming zones to be activated and have some effect.

Upon sending photos of the whole chair - which is immaculate, this changed to “wear and tear” and is not covered under warranty. I’ve repeatedly replied explaining that the chair gets very little use - as seen in the photos. Clearly there has been a quality issue with this bit of stitching - it happens. I have done nothing to make this stitching come loose and I do not expect a £300 chair to do this. I most certainly did not expect to have to argue with a company like Corsair which apparently prides themselves on quality! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I have repeatedly reminded Corsair about the Consumer Rights Act and being fit for purpose but apparently they don’t care about legislation either.

161,"July 16, 2023",2,United States,I have been a loyal Corsair supporter… I have been a loyal Corsair supporter for many years.    Generally the products are pretty good and some offer great value.    Slowly over the last few years the quality has dropped off.   Many defective parts and a hassle of a return system.    In years past it was pretty easy to return an item. This review is more about the disconnect from the company to its customers.    Several times in recent years I would order items on their website.    It says add to cart.    Then I get an email stating it’s on back order or sold out.    Well then why do you offer it on your website.    Super annoying and often times they have the tiniest print stating it’s on back order.     Not the clearest and most up front way to communicate they don’t have the item and no way of know if and when it will ship.   I bought a 2 ICUE link hub and triple 120QX kits.    I knew the stock link cables were too long.    They said they had shorter ones and done with 90degree ends.    Nope….small tiny print back ordered.   Month delay.     Typical for this company.      Soon as they went public and they answered to share holders instead of customers it was all downhill.,"Hi Chuck,Thanks for sharing your feedback with us. We're really sorry that things haven't been going smoothly with your recent experiences. Just to give you the full picture, we've been polishing up our ordering system lately, which might have resulted in some of these temporary delay messages that you were seeing. The good news is, most if not all of these back orders will actually be shipped out much sooner.Now, onto the QX Fans. We've been listening to our early adopters, and the fan cable length can vary between certain setups. In order for you to have the best experience possible with our new Link ecosystem, we would be happy to look into your specific set up and send out any additional cable to help resolve this for you.

164,"December 11, 2023",1,Sudan,"Corsair Customer Service - Worst case scenario My missing/mishandled/mis-sent purchased computer gear was damaged during its first attempted shipping to HNL and me - I never received; I've never seen; it never arrived in Hawaii; it was never delivered!  My missing computer gear, according to UPS, was immediately returned to the sender - Corsair.  The (repaired/repacked) package was subsequently resent, but somehow delivered to Deluth, GA. (not HI and me) where someone named Belinda signed for it. This mis-shipped (Georgia) package was then, again, returned to Corsair, instead of forwarded to me in HI.I received Corsair email notifications that my package had again been returned (RMA), and I was going to receive a refund. I never returned the package, never returned or signed for the package, and I never asked for a refund.After a month of chatting to bots pretending to be customer support humans - ask them what their favorite color is to see if they are human or simply an Artificial Intelligence without a soul - and being bumped up to a higher tier of customer support I was offered a 15% discount code, if I would re-order.  Of course, the discount code also did not work!I am previously invested in a Corsair platform system so moved forward with the third re-order; however, never, ever again!

167,"March 20, 2024",1,Armenia,"Their Quality and Performance is… Their Quality and Performance is degrading more and more  each year.My company has been a proponent and evangelist for Corsair products. Recently that ended with a few products having issues but the one I have now really just ended our choice to use Corsair products moving forwards as it incurred losses. It may seem trivial to others but to our little company it means everything. Here is the story.We ordered an AIO - CORSAIR iCUE Link H150i RGB Liquid CPU Cooler - 360mm. Have ordered these before and other than a noisy pump they were fairly ok, did their job. The changes to cabling for Icue Link made these worse not better of a solution however. The opposite of what Corsair intended. Cables were to short. Poor quality. Etc. But what caused the issue on this occasion is that the USB headers, tested working, could not communicate with the Controller. So the AIO performance and RGB could not be controlled/adjusted. The Pump, Fans, and Hub do not show up in Icue or in Device Manager. Also at differing brightness levels the lights make a 'buzzing sound' like old fluorescent lights. *Sighs at the absurdity. Lastly when testing the H150i I am still seeing temperatures around 86-88C under load rendering this device overpriced junk. Way to hot. Should be 5-10C lower. So basically the list goes on and on. Corsair=FAILURE.Apparently this company does not test parts before they leave the factory worth a darn so here I am, 2hours of system build and wiring into it and this thing does not work. So now I have to tell my client we will not deliver on time, greatly disappointing my customer. And this was already delayed by having to return a Corsair Case that likely Amazon damaged in shipping on same order!!I had another system with the exact same cooler so I tested its controller. Confirmed that their JUNK ICUE LINK CONTROLLER was the problem. Also that same cooler ran 10C cooler under exact same conditions/settings without any rhyme or reason.So now I have to wait 2 more days for a replacement, remove the existing one, pack it all up, and go return it to post office. I also have to again spend 1-2 hours unboxing, inspecting, installing the replacement and then rewire the system. The loss of labor for my company is about $300. Same approximate value as the part in question, and about equal to the profit margin for the sale.  (See my point?) Meaning, Corsair just made me lose money and cost me 3-4hrs extra time. So while a replacement will, if working, resolve the issue, technically, it will not recover my losses of time and expense.So for that reason alone, I will not be choosing/buying Corsair moving forwards. You do not get to waste my time without a consequence and I expect nothing from a company with such a bad customer service reputation anyhow. So congratulations to NZXT or whomever gets my business moving forwards as it won't be Corsair.For my part I will talk to all my technician friends and let them know to be wary of Corsair, as well as post reviews like this one pointing out that the Corsair controllers and cables are no longer good enough quality to be relied upon as they once were, sadly, and that they have noisier pumps, buzzing lights, etc, but actually have lower performance than previous models based on the thermals I am seeing.Id also add that all the screws and small parts were loose all over the inside of the box sloppily rattling around and stuck to the wrapped AIO magnetically. One of the little bags ripped open. So maybe rough shipping? This was however a factory sealed box not an open box item. So, just another indicator that the people on the ground at factory, or somewhere along the line are either not paid enough to care, not competent, or not committed enough to their roles, or, simply, the executives are failing at quality control to prevent these situations. Whatever leads to me being unhappy for stated reasons is harming their brand. Either way, they lost me. My time is not free. A company can only disappointment me and cost me time and money so many times before I lose all confidence.

I did, it did). So I left a ticket with Corsair support and they came back to me with a protracted and complicated procedure to prove the ram was faulty. I explained that i did not want to put the ram back into my pc as it was clearly at fault and that I had diagnosed faulty hardware the same way for 20 plus years building pcs. After a few emails back an forth they finally agreed to accept a return (to Scan in the uk) and sent me the return details and lables also requesting I sent the pair of ram rather than the single stick. I sent this off two days later. It's been a month now and no sign of my replacement ram.

To be honest I like the way it types, but the quality of the keyboard is way too low!After 1.5 month a key broke off my mechanical keyboard. Claiming that these keyboards are far more durable. I had to glue the key back on the keyboard. When I looked how the keys are fixed on the keyboard I expected more keys will break. Some other keys are so loose on the keyboard that they some times fall of when I move the keyboard to another room. This happens when the cable touches slightly the keys while moving. The top part of the keyboard is made of metal. Which is nice and give a quality feeling. However regularly when you touch the metal you can feel electricity. It is a low voltage so it is not painful but unpleasant.Another annoying issue is the backlight. When it works it is nice, simple, just 1 color. But in the 3 month I have the keyboard now I had to reset the keyboard 3 times, because half of the backlights were not working. After the rest all the light were back on. Resetting is not a big deal, but I was expecting a better quality.My next keyboard will be a mechanical keyboard again, but it will not be a Corsair!Update: After a couple of weeks I received an email from trustpilot.

Ordering a 4K60 S+ with shipping to the UK. It started with UPS tracking information being confusing, according to the info it was in the UK after which it was [back?] in Eindhoven and back in the UK and had several custom clearings along the way. Original delivery date was not respected, re-scheduled to the next day and after that again to the next day. Kindly contacting Corsair with screen copy of UPS tracking info, the actual tracking info in the e-mail, screen copy of order and order number in the e-Mail title, it took them a day to come back and ask for the order number. To which I reminded them it's in the original eMail and mentioned it again. Shortly after that UPS update with delayed delivery and no response whatsoever from support. Following that I wrote them once again, more strict (but rest assured no profanity) that I am very disappointed, that as fas as I am concerned till I have the product it's their responsibility to deliver this. And since no reply I told them I will NOT ACCEPT if the product ever arrives, have UPS sent it back and demanded a full refund.Looking at the many bad/poor reviews I should have known better and not bought anything from Corsair.31st March, still NO product and UPS has re-scheduled AGAIN (fourth time).

He came in and immediately righted all the wrongs in the universe of The United Computer Builders of Consair. Not sure why this company would let the customer become so angry before they would decide, ""OK, he's not a thief, we will help him.""  Let me give you some minor detail.  The PC tower was purchased as a gift to me from my wife.  Just the tower.  Well once I opened the box and saw what this paper weight had inside, I headed to BestBuy to complete the gaming experience. (FYI, Best Buy customer service has also been relegated to working from home folks.) so customer service with them was the very same experience of frustration and a drawn sword on policy rather than giving the customer, (who had a choice on where to shop but chose you) great service.  I bought this keyboard with a corsair gaming mouse and this gaming subwoofer with great lighting effects.  The whole system looks like Alienware but without the $6,000.00 price tag.  Once I spoke to Eric he sent a replacement keyboard, of which im using to type this review.  Would I recommend Corsair.com or any Corsair products......... Im still on the fence here, do they offer a visually appealing product? Yes!  but at what cost, I'll tell you, your sanity, your peace of mind when becoming a customer and your confidence in their willingness to help you, because at first contact all seems great until they let policy rob the customer of all confidence they had up until the customer has a tech issue.

187,"July 01, 2022",1,Benin,"Everything I have bought is faulty, and the RMA experience. I have bought two products from corsair when I built my first PC, and both were immediately faulty.Being new to PC building it took me a while to diagnose my RAM as the cause of my constant blue screens, and the loud tapping sound to be coming from my PSU; after 30 days they replace your brand-new products with refurbished so that was my first gripe; essentially the only benefit you get for buying new corsair products is the warranty as both my ram and PSU are refurbished.My experience with the advanced RMA for the RAM sticks was fine; I dealt with a few blue screens, but a replacement was on the way; not a big deal.The nightmare began when I decided that finishing my degree meant I could manage a bit of downtime if anything went wrong replacing my PSU. They offered to replace it on the 27th of April with a different 650W model, as mine was out of stock; I was happy to see that it was a slight improvement over mine, so I accepted. They then said this was out of stock and came back to me on the 12th of May with a slight upgrade to that model, so I of course accepted. I paid but received no update (until I asked for one a week later) and finally received the replacement on the 24th. This month wait was fine as I still had my faulty psu.HOWEVER, after a few days the PSU stopped working. I knew the process and the questions that they needed to ask so because of time zone differences (I live in the UK) and the fact they don’t work weekends I attempted to give them all the information they would need; I told them it failed the paperclip test and asked if I could pay for another advanced RMA. I was then given the run around for a month, unable to use my pc.“please can you do the paper clip test demonstrated below” IVE DONE IT AND TOLD YOU. Waiting days between replys“looks like we are out of stock of replacements”They then said the upgraded replacement is out of stock so they can offer me the one I originally purchased which was fine, but I had already been waiting 2 weeks at this point and just wish they would have offered that at the start.Then I hear nothing for a week and had to chase them up, telling them that I’m moving house so I may as well wait for the upgraded one to be in stock, and provided them with a new address. Then they hastily send it to my old address at the end of June causing another massive inconvenience.Overall, I was without my PC for a month, was asked for information I had already provided numerous times, not emailed for entire weeks, lost out on around £100 because the GPU crashed happened and I was unable to prove to 3 willing buyers that my old GPU worked, and I had to drive an hour both ways to pick up my replacement after they sent it to the wrong address.","Hello, we apologize for the delay in completing your warranty exchange.

189,"February 17, 2022",3,United States,"Fan hub melted/charred my fan/light cables. It hasn't been the smoothest customer experience, but it appears they do care after all. ***UPDATE 4*** Eric contacted me again, they are making the very unusual exception of sending me some new replacements with a newer hub. This is a very generous offer on their part (one I did not expect, as I cannot return the old hardware), but I think they feel the severity of my problem merits an exception, and I appreciate Eric's efforts to resolve my issue. I'm tentatively increasing my rating to 3 stars for now, I'll be updating it again when I receive them.***UPDATE 3*** Eric from the escalations team contacted me earlier today. They offered me a ""replacement of a new (not refurbished) fan kit of an alternate model"" which might work for me, but I threw out the rest of the fans + hub yesterday, so I cannot send them back.***UPDATE 2*** They responded to my previous reply by offering me a refurbished set of SP120 fans. I have let them know that I am not okay with a different variation of the same hub, and am also not comfortable with a refurbished set, given the damage the previous one caused.***UPDATE*** I originally posted this review on Thursday, 2/17/22. Corsair just responded this morning (2/22/22) by saying they would let me return the remaining hardware for two 3-packs of the same fans/hub. This is not acceptable to me, I have stated multiple times that I do not want to use the same hardware that melted and charred my wiring. They may have thought this was a generous offer, but if they had actually read my review here, and if they had reviewed my entire ticket, they would have known this would not be acceptable. Even though my fans were still under warranty, I have accepted that it is a total loss, and am going to purchase a different brand of fan. I will no longer be purchasing Corsair products for my custom PCs.I bought six corsair hd120 fans on newegg in 2020. One morning recently, I noticed the fan lights were flickering. Assuming it was a loose connection or something, I opened up the back. The fan hub fried the lighting cables in my pc, including the one for my case lighting that I had bundled with the others for cable management. The cables were blistered, charred, melted, copper wires were exposed like ginger hairs. I was terrified there'd been a fire in my case. I powered off, made sure it was grounded, and took out the fans and checked all the cabling in the case. Thankfully, nothing else was damaged, but all the fans were a loss and I need new lights for my case. I chucked three of the fans while I was digging through the pc, so they went out with the trash, my bad since I needed the serials on them. I have receipts for all of them, and pictures of the wires. I was as friendly and polite as possible, but customer support (ticket 2005077075) did not seem all that concerned about their product being a total fire hazard. They offered to replace three (out of six) fans and the hub with the same model. That didn't feel safe to me, so I asked for store credit (So I could use it to buy a newer model), since they're still under warranty, but I got turned down. Said I should contact the seller. Newegg won't help, I'm waaaay past 30 days from the sale. Really let down by the absolutely lackluster customer support. I've asked to have my ticket escalated, but I don't expect anyone to care at this point.","Hello Katherine.

194,"April 05, 2022",1,Saudi Arabia,"Brilliant products betrayed by poor customer service. I recently took ownership of a brand new Corsair I300 (ordered directly from corsairs website).  At first everything was working great and I absolutely loved the system. But then after a few weeks of daily use, the system started having random errors, such as CPU Pump failure errors, system over heating and the system fan would randomly stop working for no explainable reason allowing the system to over heat at idle. Then I opened a support ticket (2005163099) on 3/21 (approximately 14 days ago from the time of this review).  In my support ticket I included system logs, screen shots, detailed explanation of the issues that the system was having as well as steps I tried to remedy the issues that didn’t work. Responses from the first customer service were very sparse and lacking any information indicating where we were in the RMA process… And they seemed to be limited to just a single response per day. I don’t know if this is by design, or not. After a week or so of getting no where, the rep did explain to me that the lack of progress was because my issues were forwarded to the system team to review, and we are waiting for a response. If this was true, thats totally fine. But why not mention that to the customer at some point?  Finally after about 11 days or so they concluded that yep, the system isn’t operating as intended and gave me the RMA info for an exchange. This was a basic exchange, in which you send the system back and once they confirm its there, they send you a replacement back. However, in anticipation of getting the i300, I sold my old system and need a PC for work I do during the day time. I asked if I could do the advanced RMA, in which i was transferred to a new rep who said I could.  For those that don’t know, an advanced RMA lets you pay for the replacement system up front, and once they receive the return, will then refund you the money. Because this is an 5k PC, I completely understand why they would want a deposit. The new rep said that that I can do the advanced RMA, sent me a link to pay. Told me it takes 1 business day after payment for the replacement system to get mailed out. I think, great.. Finally were done and I can get my system replaced and move on with my life. I click on the link and the invoice sent to me has a balance of 0 dollars.  I email the rep back within literally 30 minutes of getting the link sent to me explaining that there is no amount to pay on the advanced RMA invoice. Two days later, finally I get a response. The response from the rep stated:“We apologize for the wait as the systems price is being updated in the back-end, this should not take any longer than a weeks time, once the updated has been set and the ARMA proceeds I will set the item to ship using express shipment. Thank you for your patience.”Is this for real? I can’t even begin to figure out what is going on here. But the run around for 14 days and then I’m asked to wait another week before shipping out a replacement I already agreed to put a deposit on?? So in total were talking about a total of at least 3 weeks to get a replacement for a defective system I purchased for more than 5,000 dollars. This is by far one of the strangest and possibly worst customer service experiences I’ve ever had with any company. I absolutely love this product… So much so I basically was just short of begging them to take my money….  I just wanted one that wasn’t defective. I’ve never been in a position where I love a product so much, but have to return it because of poor customer service.",Thank you for your review. Corsair offers a 30 day money back guarantee.

During the last month it developed issue with no output from both DisplayPort and HDMI outputs. I contacted customer service, and despite some advice to reset the CMOS, the issue unfortunately persisted. An RMA (2004743698) was commenced however after supplying documents, the following email was received: We’re sorry to inform you that CS-9020005-NA, is currently out of stock.  I will place your ticket on hold until we receive inventory, unfortunately we do not have a time frame of when that will be, I do apologize for any inconveniences.

I made sure to place an order for one which was in stock because the ONE YEAR OLD Corsair SSD in my computer, started getting bad sectors yesterday. I placed the order and about 3 hours later, received notification that it had shipped. This was surprising because it was after 6PM on a Friday. I checked the tracking info and was shocked to see that the package was being shipped from Taiwan. Before placing the order, I looked over their entire website trying to find their warehouse location. As I live 45 miles from their US office, I figured that it must be very close. In retrospect I absolutely should have driven 30 miles to Central Computers and picked up the SSD in person.I tried to cancel the order, but their website wouldn't allow it. I sent a message to their customer support explaining what had happened. I called their office in Taiwan as it was only 1:30PM there. I could not get a hold of anyone there, to find out if the order had actually shipped or only the label had been printed. I tried many different extensions, but there was no way to get past the phone tree manager.

I done a firmware update but it was still the same.I contacted Corsair support and had a RMA to send the headest back for a full refund, I thought it was a little strange at first as usually these companies try and solve your issues without having to return for a refund so I thought Corsair must be aware of this issue and there is no possible fix.I received a pre-paid label and took this to my local drop off point.

A few emails later to DHL and it was confirmed that Corsair sent me a Pre-Paid label that is only meant for shipping outside of the UK. Long story short there are apparantly two divisions within DHL, one that does international parcels and the other deals with parcels within the UK only. Because Corsair provided me with a international pre paid label even though the label clearly gives an address in the UK then the local DHL division cant track this parcel as they havent got access to the international system, and the international division of DHL state that they cannot track the item due to it being a UK delivery address.I got back in touch with Corsair and asked to be put through to a Supervisor / Manager. I think that was my worst move as ""Eric - Corsair Escalations Manager"" was absolutely no help at all. All questions and points raised with him he completely ignored and told me that no tracking information and that ""if it ever turns up then we will let you know"".

He said they would ship out a full (2 module) kit, and asked that I submit the faulty RAM, along with the other module of new RAM when I shipped it back to them.I did this. Corsair got both modules back on August 4th.However, they did not refund the hold on my credit card...My ticket was forwarded to an ""escalation manager"" who has now refused to honour the RMA for my faulty RAM. RAM which, again, was destroyed by a faulty Corsair PSU.Every time I call Corsair, their phone agents tell me that this ticket now lies with this manager. The manager doesn't seem to understand, and kept repeating that Corsair RAM is sold in pairs. He doesn't seem to care that;1) Their RAM is supposed to have a lifetime warranty, and2) A Corsair rep *already* authorized an RMA based on just one module.No there is a ~$200 hold on my credit card that they are not refunding. This is an incredibly upsetting and bad-faith business practice.I'm not sure what to do now. All I want is a replacement for my broken RAM, and to have the hold on my credit card lifted.They wrote on a previous review that I had not sent back 2 modules, which is a complete lie. I received 2, and sent 2 back to them, just as I was instructed to do on July 14th, when the RMA was approved. Now they are changing their minds.Terrible service from Corsair! If they don't fix this, I will never buy anything from them ever again.This will also be the first of *many* reviews that I will post about my experience, everywhere I can, to warn others about their shady business practices and abysmal customer service...",No Reply,<FreqDist with 12 samples and 25 outcomes>,,-0.836

The PC itself has been running fine with no concerns. The cable management was done very well. I was very happy with the GPU I received (3070 Founders Edition) and the pc runs quiet with no issues. There are 2 reasons to consider a vengeance pc. 1.  You know all the parts you get outside of the GPU. Your getting a corsair PSU, AIO Cooler, RAM, MSI Motherboard, etc. A lot of other places will cheap out on at least 2 of these areas when they don't state what you exactly get. 2. The quality vs price performance is very competitive. I compared this to a boutique pc builder and it was about $300 cheaper than that one when you pack it with corsair parts.

Almost everything in my PC build is from Corsair: Mouse, keyboard, fan coolers, water cooler, RAM, and mousepad. However, whenever I need help diagnosing an issue, I honestly just feel better off buying a whole new product. Spending extra money feels like an easier solution than trying to get a hold of Corsair's customer support.I recently had to contact them with some fans that were miscolored. They were from a 3-pack, and all three of the fans were showing signs of defects. I contacted them, and it took over a week in order to hear back from them. Once they finally got back to me, the customer support agent was trying to make me do some troubleshooting and fixes that I knew for sure weren't the issue. One of the fixes was to test all 8 of my fans (one at a time) on a single port. Seriously? After two weeks of communication, some responses took only two hours, some took two days, I finally got a replacement order sent through.I had to contact them again because my fans were not showing up the right color. Once again, I contacted them and it took about 1-2 weeks for a response. It turns out that my two Commander Pros and Node Lighting Cores were configured really weirdly. I was able to fix it on my own while I was waiting for a response from them, but my fans were starting to show 1500RPM on idle when they were much, much quieter in the past.I waited 3-4 days at a time for a single response, with the response being as bland as ""Can you send me a screenshot of your iCue cooling setup?"" or ""The fan is faulty."" (Even though my fan was working initially and was new right out of the box).Their iCue program is tough to navigate around. I had to try troubleshooting on their support website several of times, but their site was down for an extended period of time. I had to go to Reddit, with nobody having the same issue as me. My most recent ticket has been ongoing for three weeks with no progress being made. My PC is collecting dust (had to put a towel over it) since I need to keep it undone so that I can continue trying to troubleshoot the issues, which takes days in between responses.Honestly, if I didn't spend so much money on Corsair, I would've went with a different company for my PC coloring and accessories.","Thank you for the review, Eric.

Thoroughly enjoyed the aluminum build quality and the cherry MX speed switches (silver). This was accompanied by great iCue integration and very good documentation.My only hindrances was that the RGB was a tad bit dull for my liking, and that the wrist wrest gets dirty quickly along with the aluminum frame attracting dust easily.Apart from minor issues the keyb was amazing.Fast forward a few months.I decide to buy the Corsair MM300 extended mousepad. I buy it, it was a bit pricy so I bought it on sale and I love it. The design is cool and the feel is great.Once again, only issues;Colour fades from silver to slight brown hue over time.The surface attracts particles and debris (bad for mouse glides).Fast forward another year or so.I build a new rig, and I am having a great experience with Corsair, so I decide to invest in some of their components.For reference this is an RTX 3080 system with a 5800x, so I was not messing around.

258,"August 02, 2021",2,Lao People's Democratic Republic,"Lacks in soft- and hardware quality I've owned three Corsair items now - two mice, one headset. The mice were years ago - Ironclaw model gaming mice. They were nice for a couple months each - felt nice in my hand, were fairly light, and for all intents and purposes, for the first period of time, their iCUE software actually worked and provided some pretty good performance. Cue the issue with Ironclaw mice hardware - their mousewheels were *not* built to last. Both mice I had, had their mouse wheel break after just shy of 1 or 2 months, when I barely even used them. And I mean *break.* Not the button, the wheel itself broke out of its casing and lodged it inside of the mouseframe entirely unusable for either middle-moude button clicks or scrolling.Then shortly after, iCUE turned its ugly head, randomly disconnecting, reconnecting or just plain old shutting down my mouse while in use, leaving me forced to uninstall iCUE and get the mouse working again without any user profiles whatsoever. At least the Logitech mouse I had after that, had on-board memory to store profiles on if their software crapped out. So I was two mice lighter, didn't bother writing tickets because I had deadpan figured after the second breakage that the broken mouse wheel is a blatant flawed design with cheap, unworthy plastic.Now, I have a newly purchased Void RBG Elite headset. Feels nice and comfortable, and the frame feels surprisingly sturdy for what I am used to from Corsair. Caveat? Software. Due to *something* being messed up in the on-board software, the volume output of the microphone for the receiving party's end, is about as audible as a cricket next to a fully loaded freight locomotive booming past at full speed. Inaudible - and that is with Discord settings on both our ends and Windows settings at maximum. For a gaming headset, that's simply unacceptable. I've looked around on the forums and discovered this is a *known issue,* with plenty of cases writing similar problems, and instead of having an official fix, people are told to just open a ticket - which as you can read here, is a sometimes-hit-very-often-miss experience. Other users suggested third party software such as EqualizerAPO, which I tried and got working to good effect.But Corsair, for the love of everything holy. You're a big company advertising high-end gaming equipment. If people need to get third-party software to even work with it, you've failed in a very basic, highly important aspect of peripheral design - *make sure your basics work.* Your software was unstable then, and it has a strong tendency to be simply faulty today. Step up your game. Not for me, for I won't be buying anything Corsair ever again, but for anyone who yet has faith in your gear.","Thank you for the review, Roel.

I contacted corsair & requested an RMA, this took weeks to get going & their excuse then was something nonsensical for a company of their size & stature, nevertheless i was sent a replacement pair eventually & they too presented the same ear pad problem & deterioration of sound quality in less than a year-they too were returned (albeit Corsair initially sent out a pr of replacement earpads FOR A HEADSET THAT ONE CANNOT CHANGE THE EARPADS ON)-the HS70's earpads are not meant to be changed so if there are problems logic dictates that one has to return the whole headset, which i did after numerous failed attempts to change the earpads-i get the feeling that Corsair wanted the customer to try swapping out the earpads and if they broke the headset in so doing, they would'nt have to replace the headset). So i requested yet another RMA because i was stuck with a headset with audio problems and earpads that couldnt be swapped out (Google HS70 earpad replacement & you will see a myriad of videos & posts as to their substandard quality-in fact the headset itself has a ridiculously high amount of complaints about it)These too were returned & eventually replaced with another new pair.So  i had had 2 RMAs for a headset that could & didn't even last a full year of medicore usage- but i bit the bullet & accepted the fact that i had spent my money on a poor product.Around three weeks ago the latest headset that they had sent (and which was supposedly new & was LESS that 1 yr old), started presenting problems in keeping its battery charge, they would keep a charge for no more than 5 min!So yet again i requested an RMA 3 weeks ago(it was going to be my last) but i was livid!-how in gods name can Corsair keep shipping out products that were substandard (by the way ALL of my headsets were in mint condition & my RMA claims valid-i kept photos, should proof be needed-i say this because if they were not, there is no way that Corsair would have sent out replacements if there was one iota of a chance that i was to blame for the heaset's poor functioning).My RMA was accepted,this time i asked if i could pay the difference and get a better headset,that had better reviews-the logic behind my request being  hopefully i could pay the difference & end up with a headset that actually lasted more than one year!I was told that that wasnt possible, but instead of a new HS70 would i accept a VOID headset since i didnt want another HS70.The thing is that the VOID is a gaming headset-i had made it clear that i dint use my headset for gaming, ergo me purchasing the HS70.My requests were denied & so i sent a long communique laying out the myriad of times that Corsair screwed up & i requested that my communique be sent to a supervisor.Thats when the attitude and passive agressive behaviour started from Corsair.I was sent a reply today that said :""I do apologize for the delayed response I had my supervisor review this information.Unfortunately this original headset was purchased in 2018 and the warranty has been expired for over a year.We are still willing to do a courtesy replacement for a refurbished unit of the same model of your original headset.Please let me know how you would like to proceed.""So we went from initially being offered a new HS70 or a VOID headset,to a refurbished HS70!And their point was  the warranty had expired-strange in that i was sent a new headset as replacement, so were they not under warranty-apparently not.I debated that fact, to which Corsair representative M stated that they were now willing to only offer a refurbished model and that id better make my mind up or else  they would close the ticket.I was being bullied into accepting a refurbished item of a model that when new stopped working in less than a year-so how long would the refurbished model work for; 3-5 months if  lucky?The speed & manner in which Corsair went from offering to replace my headset for a NEW different model, to stating that either i accept an item(refurbished) that would fall apart in a few months or tough luck buddy, is astounding.Bullying a customer when not needed just because you have the power to do so says alot about Corsair's doctrine, no wonder they only have 2 stars here.Others have the same HS70 issue on Trust Pilot see below","Hello Kkorkykatt.

The case came with three 120 mm ICUE fans in the front of the case. I started using the PC in January and after only 4½ months, one of the front ICUE case fans started rattling very loudly when the PC is powered up.I sent and email to Corsair Customer Support on Sunday, 5/23/21 asking if they could send a replacement fan.  By Mid-day Tuesday I had a response from them asking for the serial number and copy of the receipt.  I sent them the requested info on Wednesday morning.  Thursday morning I was notified that the new fan was being shipped free of charge, and it was delivered to my front porch on Friday morning.  I installed the fan Friday afternoon and my PC is once again running quiet as a church mouse.  To my way of thinking, this rapid response, with email updates from Corsair every step of the way, including a delivery notification, constitutes superior customer service.

289,"May 06, 2021",1,Australia,"Worst customer service ever! On March 16th, 2021, I ordered my first PC, a Corsair Vengence a7200 Series Gaming PC. Before the purchase, I did tons of research on building my own pc but with the current price-gouging of GPUs, I decided the quickest and most effective way to get the PC I wanted was to get a pre-built or custom-built one. It came down to NZXT or Corsair but decided to go with Corsair because they had the 3070 in stock, or so I thought. On their website, they clearly stated that due to supply issues (probably with the GPU), to expect a 2-3 week shipping delay. I was good with that. Wanting a clean setup, I also purchased a Corsair keyboard and mouse. $2320.77 later, my first PC was soon to be on its way. Or so I thought. Fast forward to April 2nd when I sent my first inquiry into the shipping status. On April 5th, I got a reply from Marge(Corsair) stating that the order was shipped and delivered. I replied letting them know that wasn't in fact the case and the only keyboard and mouse were received.  On April 6 after tirelessly trying to get ahold of someone who can help through their website support line, which, I don't think actually work ""for"" Corsair, but instead are a 3rd party, I know, shocker, I then got an email from Michael who told me that according to the ""system"" my pc was at the warehouse and will be delivered in 2 weeks. That would make it 5 weeks from purchase, but hey, we're in trying times and there's an obvious GPU shortage, so ok, I thanked Michael for the help and continued to wait. Two weeks later, on April 20th, still no pc, so I followed up with Michael on the same email thread and again called customer service trying to get some clarity on the matter. On April 26th, I got an email from Michael saying that he's having to escalate this case to the relevant team. On April 27th, I got an email from Ruth, apologizing for the delay and happy to let me know the PC is on its way. She provided a tracking number and obviously, this was something I checked daily. Good thing I did because on the 28th, the tracking link informed me that it was sent BACK TO CORSAIR!!! No email, no explanation, no NOTHING!!!!I spent the next few days trying to contact someone ""at"" Corsair, but again only got their 3rd party customer service agent. I don't know what to call them, but they definitely aren't equipped to handle such a situation. Glory who helped me during this call kept referencing that she needed to connect with the website team which is who I thought I was talking to. When she referenced the warehouse team, I had hoped to also connect with them, so that they can resend my pc and we can work through whatever shipping issues there were. Quick note: I live in Guam, a US territory with 2 massive military bases. We have USPS, FedEx, DHL, UPS, etc, and follow standard US shipping rates. For easy reference, we're like a mini Hawaii without the statehood. Anyways, back to the matter. I also called UPS to find out why they sent it back. Was transferred to the Hazardous Shipping Department. It seems they flagged the package based on incorrect labeling of the battery? I don't know what more to say, that was all they were able to provide and told me to follow up with Corsair. On May 4th, I got an automated email response letting me know they received my ""return"" and will be processing my refund. What in the absolute F!!!Again, I tried calling and only got the response of we're escalating your matter to the appropriate team. My emails were also met with zero replies. In fact, I got an email from Ruth not addressing me at all, but just saying my request was closed and merged with the request. That made no sense to me, so I asked for clarity, but still, 2 days later have not heard a single word from Corsair. It's May 6th, 51 Days since ordering my first PC. I haven't gotten my refund. I haven't received any further customer service about my purchased pc. NOTHING!!! So buyer beware. I will never be purchasing anything from Corsair and if I could go back in time, I would've simply purchased the NZXT unit, which is what I'll be doing once I get my refund from Corsair, if they ever get around to issuing one. So that's my story with Corsair.Update 5/7/2021 - Actually got in touch with someone on their Facebook page who I think got me in touch with their Escalations Manager.

295,"April 26, 2021",1,United States,"Incompetent from Top to Bottom One star because there's no zero. Worst customer support I've experienced in years, if ever. I ordered a fully kitted out gaming PC for my retirement from Corsair (branded as Origin PC). Here's what three months and nearly $14,000 got me. First, it arrived dead with two of eight disks (25%) non-functional. Origin tried to blame shipping but after pulling one of the disks I could see it was installed incorrectly. It was mounted with the wrong screw and it caused a visible bend. I sent photos to Origin and they admitted it was their fault and ""expedited"" replacement parts in four days rather than the normal ten. Neither disk worked. One was DOA and the other was the wrong part with a mount for a different motherboard. That's two strikes already (or more, depending on how you count).They decided to have me ship it to them for repairs. This was a bit of a concern because of how it came packed. Origin ships in heavy wooden crates assembled with dozens of screws and industrial staples. It's a completely unnecessary gimmick and it makes repacking an intimidating task. My concerns were worsened by the packing ""instructions"" they sent. It was a long list of *what* to pack and one single line on *how* to pack (bolded and highlighted in the original):Package your system securely (**Failure to do so may lead to shipping damage that ORIGIN PC will not be responsible for.**)I needed a bit more assurance that this wasn't some kind of scam, with how quickly they tried to blame shipping initially it seemed like their go-to move. I contacted them with my concerns and was ghosted for three days. No replies, no calls back, nothing. That was strike three, I was done with this company. I called and said that I want a refund and it's up to them to deal with the packing. After talking to three different techs someone was finally willing to go on the record that I wouldn't be held liable for shipping damage, once UPS picks it up it's on them. So I packed it up, replacing a couple broken bits as best I could.Apparently not one of those three techs wrote down that I wanted a refund, because I got an email after sending it back that they were repairing it and it would be shipped soon. I emailed to say that it was a return, not a repair, and that's when they went from incompetent to insulting. They said I would be charged a 15% restocking fee and have to pay all the shipping. I'd be paying over $2,500 for the fun of doing QA's job. After threatening lawyers I got a written confirmation of a 100% refund within 3-5 days. After 15 days of waiting with no response I got a refund through a chargeback with my credit card.

For context you need to know a bit of my ordeal with Corsair:""I purchased a Scimitar Pro RGB mouse from a third-party retailer (Currys/PC World) and everything has been all hunky-dory with the mouse however, start of March 2021 the mouse starts having a known fault with the scroll wheel. Unfortunately, I am unable to send it back to where I purchased the device from (really wish I could as it would save me writing this review and dealing with the headache that is known as 'Eric - Corsair's Escalations Manager'.... yeah I named and shamed as his customer service skills are a joke).The defective mouse is well within it's warranty and I speak with a very helpful and pleasant CS representative called Simona (praise where praise is due) and we get the ball rolling for a replacement product to be sent out following the RMA process - no problems so far (y). Under the impression the replacement is for a like-for-like swap my product is returned to Corsair in original packaging with all original contents included with no scratches or visible imperfections to the device (got to keep devices in top shape when gaming). Roll on two weeks after I send my device and I receive a ""Certified Refurbished"" replacement from Taiwan in laughable packaging (wish I could post pictures).... obviously not happy with the replacement provided I send an email to Corsair with pictures (admittedly it was a bit of a 'spicy' email but no abuse directed at the Corsair CS staff.... got to keep it friendly). Forward on a day and I get escalated to Eric and his first response is generic and didn't address my concerns raised in the 'spicy' email I had sent prior. Additionally, he had the audacity and I quote, to say: ""The replacement mouse will meet your needs, and should not have any difficulty with the scroll wheel.""I entertain the idea of the refurbished device and give the replacement a test, low and behold it has the same problem as the mouse I sent back (got to love it when they have to eat their own words and bold claims.... it's class).I am now going to have to go through the same RMA process to get this refurbished mouse replaced with another refurbished mouse (not holding my breath for their ""meet your needs"" quality).""To summarise if you have to RMA your product, expect a ""Certified Refurbished"" product that comes in poor packaging that doesn't meet your needs. Additionally, when sending the faulty product back don't make the mistake of sending it in the original packaging, as that's not what your replacement is coming back in. If a Corsair rep is reading this..... please get rid of Eric or put him on a training course in customer service as he really needs a refresh since going into his position (I am not even sorry for these little jabs). Additionally, please can you sort me out a new replacement mouse :)...... I will update the review in due course :)Kind regards,AdamPS.

Their UK customer service appears to be none-existent - literally, it doesn't exist. I had an issue with an Amazon order and they couldn't even give me UK support details. If Amazon can't, who can?When you do find some contact details, they're all American phone numbers - and not wanting to be charged the price of my item just for the pleasure of waiting on the line to try and return it, you'll no doubt opt for the live chat instead as I did. Surprise surprise - it's a bot, and a rather crap one at that. It tries it's absolute upmost to be helpful and make suggestions but generally, it's just a bad experience. I had a very simple issue and needed return something, it took far far too long to finally get it to raise an RMA ticket for me. This sort of service would be acceptable if there was a 'local' phone line to fall back on.

346,"January 05, 2021",2,Suriname,"Warranty/Returning issues I ordered a K95 RGB Platinum XT keyboard directly from Corsairs website, after a few days of waiting it arrived. processing and shipping time wasn't bad at all. However upon opening the box (Which the box was in perfect condition) I found the keyboard with a damaged corner on the aluminum and a rattling noise inside the keyboard. So I called Corsair and spoke to someone and said that the keyboard was damaged and send pictures and so on. So they approved the warranty. But that wasn't the issue. What made me actually irritated considering I got this keyboard on sale for $159.99 instead of the steep $199.99 price tag was that I found out after receiving the email with what I thought was a shipping label, was just a shipping address. Why would I pay shipping twice on something that wasn't right the first time??? So I called and asked if they expect me to pay the shipping for a warranty item I've owned for no more than 10 minutes before noticing a manufacturer defect or damage. Their reply was yes because you're returning it to us for warranty. I told them that it would basically defeat the sale price on it and at that point I might as well just actually return it and get a Logitech keyboard. However the guy I was talking to said they could send a prepaid shipping label which he did. The problem was resolved but when you find your product damaged upon arrival you should not have to worry about paying shipping AGAIN to just get the brand new keyboard that you were actually expected instead of a beat up one. This is just more or less alarming to me especially when I'm also considering purchasing a Mouse from them as well. Makes me wonder if I want to even buy a mouse from their company. I've owned lots of logitech keyboards and mice and have had to call for warranty on a keyboard through them before and they sent a new keyboard almost no questions asked other than what the problem was and shipped a new one out and didn't even make me return the old one (which I found odd but hey)","Hello Aaron.

Although corsair did not honor their words, I am assured the replacement is as good as what I requested. According to them this was the only headset (of the entire range) left in stock. Overall: negative experience dealing with the returns process, I appreciate it's a pandemic so people are working from home. However, this does not excuse people from not responding to all queries raised or providing me with a means to make a complaint, which I asked to do several times. ---------------------------------------------Update:I have now been pressurised in either accepting what they are offering (although this is different to what was initially discussed) or to have a refund... I have also requested it someone can call me as typing is an issue but this was ignored, as was my request to provide me with details in relation to how I can make an official complaint. ----------------------------------------------------Due to a physical disability I have to be picky in the computer peripherals i use. spent weeks testing products and then decided to spend £400 on corsair peripherals (mouse, keyboard, headset, wireless charging mousepad, lapad).Raised support query in relation to headset, after following instructions still had issues with headset... advised to raise an RMA (2003755892). At this point I asked if a headset can be posted to me first, and then I would sent out the faulty headset as I use this for speech to type.  Advisor said this is not possible even though on their website they mentioned that you can do this as long as you use a credit card for a holding fee. Nevertheless, I waited several days for return labels, received two emails with two different return addresses, one in UK and one in Holland.  I was confused with where this had to go, so I sent it to the address that was sent to me in the first email.I received an email, 1 week ago, saying that my headset had been received, and processed and a new headset should be dispatched in 1 business day.   Spoke to several different customer service representatives thereafter, who came up with many different stories from ""the item has been picked and is to be dispatched"", to ""we are not sure why you have not had a replacement yet"".  At this point I was advised that a tier 3 escalation had been done, I waited several days, chased up several times and still no response from the tier 3 team.  I was then finally emailed by a lady who explained that my headset was out of stock, and due to the inconvenience I am able to upgrade to another headset.  I emailed back, thanked the advisor and explained that I would like to have the VIRTUOSO RGB WIRELESS SE High-Fidelity Gaming Headset — Gunmetal (EU) and I would not mind paying the difference.  The conversation then went quiet, I assume this is because they do not work weekends, so I called this morning to see if it had been dispatched.  The advisor on the telephone said to me that this upgrade cannot happen, and he could not see an escalation to tier 3.  He said he would contact the advisors involved to try to resolve this... however, apart from the lady who actually offered a solution, the other advisors involved just provided misinformation and confusion to create an atmosphere of chaos.Corsair, please do not make false promises if you cannot keep them.  Please do not respond to emails if you have not completely read them.  Most importantly, please do not provide information which is factually incorrect - this just leads to frustration and confusion. p.s. in case you have skimmed this post, like some of my support ticket responses, I use your headset to be able to communicate with the word (speech to text), so I hope you can appreciate why this has become a big issue for me.","Thank you for the review, and our apologies for any misunderstandings with your recent ticket.

The worst customer service I've experienced, incompetent, ignorant and careless.I've had a ticket open for two weeks to get a warranty replacement on a mouse, and I'm no closer to achieving an outcome than I was when I originally started.The support didn't even read my first ticket, I stated I had tried all the firmware updates on the mouse. They sent me details on how to update the firmware. I called and held for an hour, the automated holding system cut me off. I called back later to get through to someone who actually took a payment from me to expedite my replacement, I waited 6 days to call up and find out that the shipment had been cancelled. I got through to someone on the phone who doesn't even work in customer support to be told they'll pass the ticket on to customer support. The RMA process for this company is absolutely lacklustre and by far the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I really feel bad for the people that work there, how can a process be so detrimental for a customer who's bought a product.

About a week after his birthday the chair turned up !!Very nice chair my son can now enjoy the comfort of his much deserved gaming chair.But no.10 months later the fabric underneath has become detached and all the wheels have fallen apart.Again we contacted Corsair customer services and point out the faults send pictures etc.We now have to send the chair back at our expense £30.00 !!They did offer a free DHL return but the nearest point ( and we live near a major city) that accepts parcels of this size is a 60 mile round trip.We complained that this wasn’t acceptable so they came up with the amazing idea to send us a new chair and charge us another £300 until we return the faulty one.No chance.Kaylae was the person from Corsair customer services that answered our many emails ( usually after about 3-4 days of sending them )In the end they said our claim had been settled and a new unit would be sent out. We then messaged back to ask if this was a replacement chair and to confirm we didn’t have to send the old one back ?But no reply to confirm.We received our package today a new set of wheels to fit ourselves.Didn’t even address the problem with the fabric becoming detached.Such a large company with such low standards.UpdateCorsair you had your chance to put things right we’re not wasting anymore time on your generic answers to all trust pilot comments.Just please stop selling cheaply sourced gaming chairs.,"Hello Lyrical, and thank you for your review.

Hello John,I'm sorry for the issues with the memory kit. We can of course replace the memory kit for you, however at this time we do not have this item in stock.Please note that any replacement would be for another memory kit of the same time. We do not have a paid upgrade option.Also, please note that memory kits are intended to be used alone. If you are using two memory kits in the same computer at the same time, this may or may not work properly or even at all. Using multiple memory kits in the same computer at once is entirely unsupported. The two different memory kits working together is a matter of luck. This is why we sell matched memory kits.I understand that you want to send in CMSX32GX4M2A3000C16 x2 for replacement, or a total of 4x16gb. We can do this, but as noted above, there is no guarantee that both memory kits will work together.At this time we do not have any quad matched memory kits of this capacity and speed in the SODIMM form factor.EricCorsair Escalations Manager----------------------------------------------------------So i decided to call after being bounced around 4 times i was left on hold for 2hrs until the company customer service closed at 8pm (called at 6pm today) wonderful. the first representative did try to help me a little but what she offered me was a complete downgrade of 2133 value ram when i have 3000 vengance ram,  I also asked for my money back since they dont have the kit via email.Update 2So after speaking with 6 reps the following day I got one who promised me a 3600 cl16 32gb kit because I waited almost 2 weeks with no laptop.

381,"October 21, 2020",5,Spain,"Top support I honestly was quite scared of having problems with my Corsair products after reading so many negative reviews and that many search results appearing on Google with problems on AIO coolers.In august I bought the Carbide 275Q (Silent) case, an AIO Cooler (H100i Platinum) and a RM750x PSU.The PSU works perfectly, it seems to be really of a good quality (hope it lasts).The case is of an acceptable quality though I honestly would have preferred to pay 10-20€ more and have better, more sturdy materials. Also, the left side panel does not perfectly align to the back of the tower and the thumbscrews are not the greatest quality. All in all, the case is still decent.My only problem occurred with the AIO cooler. Right from the start, one of the fan’s LEDs would not light up. Suddenly they did, but after a month or so they went dark once and for all. I then started a ‘partial RMA’ with Corsair, since the Spanish vendor would require sending everything back, which would have been quite a hassle.To sum it up, the support worked flawlessly at all points. I got moderately quick replies (I don’t think it was more than 2-3 days between replies) and all the time the answers were absolutely reasonable to all my questions or feedback. I got a full refund of the involved shipping costs of me sending the fan to the Netherlands and also the ‘dispatch’ I had to pay to FedEx when the replacement fan was delivered (this would be the only point I would try to improve if I were Corsair). Still, for me everything worked out.

As we've upgraded our home PC's etc. we avoid Corsair PSU's and SSD's, here's why.We've upgraded our SSD's over the years and now have some NMVE's instead. Only one has ever died, yes it was the Corsair, and it had to be sent to Europe for a replacement, a costly affair back then.Next up I buy an RM850X, supposedly their 'premium' 850W PSU. I Decided to use it a few weeks after buying it, and it had coil whine, which is quite annoying, so I asked Corsair, now that it was too late to get a refund, about this, and they said return it and they'll send me a new one. But I had to pay for returning it. I objected to this expense, they stuck to their guns, and I decided to just leave it aside as a spare.Remember these PSU's are meant to have 3 to 7 year warranties for those in use, let alone one that hasn't been used for more than a few hours. So now my son decides to use it, and yes that noise is still so annoying, so he asks for an RMA, and they ask him for videos of it etc. He obliges. Then they want a receipt, so he sends this, and they object that it's only the top half of a PC World receipt, they want the rest of it too. They want to know what else I bought, and want to see the credit card details of the card I paid for it with.

I was going to give in, remember no full receipt no repair by the looks of it, and this is yet another company that has no respect for your data and wants more than it is entitled to, and send them the full receipt, but my son just gave up and said he'll just live with the coil whine.So they kept asking for info deliberately so that only the most ardent of customers will get a repair, hence they clearly try to make sure that most give up. The irony is that they already had the proof of purchase etc. as they issued an RMA for it two years ago, but want the receipt again, and wouldn't issue one unless the rest of the receipt was provided that had details I do not wish to share with them. Note that the half that was given has a 'goods collected' stamp on it, the item name, item code, price paid, name and address of the PC World branch on it etc, hence my annoyance at their wanting yet more.Our other PSU's are EVGA, and can you guess why we don't know that their support is like? We've never needed it as they are so much better built than Corsair products, likewise for our Samsung SSD's and Sabrent NVME's. Nice Keyboards though, but quite pricey new, usually pick up used, as apart from good clean, it will be as good as new, and even Corsair can't mess up sticking a bunch of Cherry Key switches on an aluminium plate.","Hello Asma.

Within 2 hours I was on the phone cancelling the order. Regardless of the case not being what I needed, a few things happened: 1) I never received a confirmation email for the case. 2) The number they gave me to check on the status of the order was not correct (given to me over the phone). 3) I was told my credit card would only be charged if the item was shipped, but noticed a charge almost immediately.Over the course of a month, I called many times to get clarification on the issues with the order and was told by more than one agent that the order is cancelled, and my card would be refunded. That never happened. Instead, when I made a ticket about this issue, the agent said your item should be at the destination soon and gave me a tracking number.I know I can just refuse delivery at the door, but this whole thing has now become such a drawn-out process, and I live in a very remote part of my country.

I contacted corsair, showing all the original packaging and serial numbers. After reading loads of horror stories online, regarding corsair customer service. It was my turn.

By all accounts! These power supply units, don't like cold starts. Complete waste of money. When I first fitted it, one of the screw holes was already stripped. Do not buy a corsair unit from ebay. They don't recognise ebay as official sellers. When indeed, you bought it brand new. They class it as second hand?? Absolutely despicable customer service. Better still! Buy another make of psu.

An ""escalations manager"" got in touch with me and told me that a new memory set had been dispatched and that I should return the one that was set to me by mistake as soon as it arrives.This took another couple of days, but now it is all sorted.In conclusion, I raised the rating to three stars as it still took 3 weeks overall that I couldn't use my computer, which is not great in times of ""working from home"". This seems to be also somewhat in line with the average rating (2.3 at the time of writing)Edit 3:This is going from bad to worse and from worse to ridiculous.Corsair has now sent me replacement memory, but much to my surprise instead of my 2x16GB kit, they have sent me a 4x8GB kit. I don't want a 4x8GB kit as I won't be able to upgrade to more memory later. I wrote them that I would like a 2x16GB kit, please, as this was what I paid for. Or a refund.As a reply I got an email telling me that they ""will not be providing any further warranty services based on the current situation"".In other words, to cut my losses I can now sell the 4x8GB kit on Ebay and buy myself a 2x16GB kit again.But surely from a different manufacturer.Edit 2:As expected, nothing happens.

After a few short hours, the SATA power cable went on fire causing damage to other components and further cost on replacing the other components in ny PC. I have been in contact with customer services about replacing the cooler to be told they don't have it in stock and are willing to replace it with the XT version which performs better than the one I had but doesn't look as good (in my opinion) only to be told they don't have either in stock. I was then asked if I would accept a lower model which is way cheaper than I paid for. I rang customer services today after numerous emails looking to speak to a manager to find out that the person looking after my case is higher than the manager they could put me onto. My last communication requested if they couldn't replace the product or equal value or better, to refund me so I can buy it from a different merchant. It has been one of the worse customer experiences with any company. The company is an absolute joke, still waiting on an email/cal about an update on the exact replacement of my product. I highly recommend not buying any Corsair product as all you will get is faulty products prone to damage and unhelpful.","Hello David. Thank you for your review.

I have an intel k sku processor, so I don't have a backup cooler.The first week was slow due to Corsair communication, then another week until I could get the product shipped.

However, since then my package has been sitting in a warehouse, because in order to receive my free replacement unit I would have to pay 170 CAD in shipping fees.UPS has called me 1-3 times every day for the past 4 weeks to tell me to pay 170 dollars to have my package released. I have notified corsair numerous times and they keep telling me the ""Logistics Team"" is looking into it.Last week Corsair even tried to close my RMA telling me that it was fixed and my package will arrive shortly. When it didn't arrive after a couple days I had to look into it with UPS, and they are still holding my package until payment, so I had to contact corsair again to tell them to reopen my case, which they finally did, but another week has passed with my package still sitting at the warehouse.Roughly 5 weeks now my PC has been a paper weight.

426,"July 23, 2020",1,Canada,"BUYER BEWARE TLDR: Dishonours warranty policies with loopholes and scams the consumer in the process. Buyer beware.Imagine you bought a brand-new car, and one day you’re driving it down the highway when suddenly, you start shaking. One of your tires has a leak! You pull over to the side and inspect the tire and sure enough, it’s a flat, with a hole on the side. You in the middle of nowhere, and you have no way of getting home. You patch the tire, so you can take it into the dealership. Now, imagine, when that same dealership now refuses to work on your car because you voided the entire warranty by performing an unauthorized service. How speechless would you be?	Thank goodness, when this happened to me my dealership took me in right away, and apologized profusely for the mishap, even though they had nothing to do with it. We choose brands because they stand behind their products, and their customers. 	I received this water cooler from my girlfriend as a present for my 23rd birthday after building my first PC. Up until recently, it worked reliably. A month ago, I started to notice serious issues with my PC. It would just randomly shut down when I would be working on homework or playing video games. When I inspected further, I noticed that sometimes the temperature would spike up, which didn’t happen before. At first, I thought it was the thermal compound, so I cleaned the CPU and reapplied some paste. About 2 weeks ago, I turned on my computer and within a minute of starting it up it would shut down again. I did this a couple times and sure enough, the CPU kept getting hotter and hotter, from an idle room temperature of 29C to 93C, which is when it would shut down. I started to freak out. I had a major assignment worth 20% of my final grade, and my computer was failing. I took the PC apart. I started to inspect the GPU, the fans, everything worked! So, what was the problem? It must be something to do with the cooling, because even the CPU was working fine. That’s when I took off the radiator, to find a bubble in the top that was leaking. I immediately took it off and wiped it off. I sealed the area with glue to temporarily seal the hole. I contacted Corsair immediately, filing a warranty claim, as well as reaching out to Corsair via telephone. Sonny F., was excellent in explaining the details of the Advanced RMA, and how I would ship my product back for an exchange, yet conveniently neglected to explain that it wouldn’t even be covered cause I PLUGGED A LEAKING HOLE. They put a charge of $88.88 USD or ~$125CAD on my credit card. Great. Problem solved, right? Nope, wrong. I had no way of using my computer. I tried using the water cooler again, in hopes it would get me through the night but nothing worked. At 7 pm, with COVID-19 hours, I was totally screwed. My computer would not turn on. I found an air cooler at my local Canada Computers and placed it on hold immediately. The day after, I went to go pick it up and sure enough, it was the cooler that was the problem. Fast forward a week later to yesterday, when as soon as my product was received, I get an email from Corsair saying that the warranty is void because there was an “unauthorized repair”. So convenient for them to wait until item is received to deny the warranty. I didn’t even ship them back the defective product! Anything they can do to not have to honour their policies, and scam the customer in the process. I have emailed numerous times, and no response. I try calling, and phone lines are disengaged due to overwhelmingly high ticket volumes. Hmm I wonder why. 	In life, these things happen, but what makes or breaks us how we choose to deal with them. Unprofessional business practices not only hurt the customer but hurt the bottom line. I am returning the product today, in the mail in hopes we can come to a resolution. As per Corsair policy, I have 14 days. If I do not receive a refund immediately, rest assumed this issue will be escalated until I have absolutely no connection to this company and its shady business practices.

So they have to cancel my order, and ask me to place the order again (which I cannot do because the PSU is out of stock). Which I now understand they lied to me in the first place.

I first thought it must be the COVID-19 and was patiently waiting, but I ordered lots of things from where else during this time period and usually the shipping is slow not the processing. So I decided to read some reviews to see if anyone having the same issue and found out people have been complaining about Corsair order status for years.I can understand the COVID situation, but shouldn't Corsair just let people know that their order process will take few weeks before shipping so that they can plan accordingly? I bought all my PC parts and they're already here waiting for this PSU. And in about 2 weeks, I will not be able to return them if they have problem (out of returning window) because I don't have a PSU to test them.I don't want to go harsh on Corsair with this virus going on, but they shouldn't put me into a situation where I have no choice but to complaint to get things straight out.Stay healthy people!!!","Hello Ryu.

No estimated delivery date on the confirmation email. I couldn’t find this out due to there being practically no contact with customer service through any traditional channel nor social media. This can be attributed to their current backlog as a result of the ongoing COVID situation. They were out of service levels at an abnormally high rate compared to other similar retailers.

Money was transferred instantly and then crickets even after opening a ticket. I had to call customer service to find out what exactly the ""Booked"" status meant. I received the same vanilla response it seems most have received with this issue. I understand delays but to use a blanket excuse like this Covid nonsense as the reason you have collected money from so many without so much as standard generated response or an update is ridiculous!

This includes following WHO and CDC guidelines in our shipping and order processing hubs, maintaining social distancing, providing staff with face masks and gloves, and frequent cleaning.Due to extremely high order volumes and the added complexity of responding to the threat of COVID-19, your order may take longer to reach you than initially stated at checkout. We understand your urgency and appreciate your patience with these delays. We are working hard to ship orders promptly, and are hiring more staff and expanding our warehouse operations to meet demand.

This was a demonstration that Corsair is capable of great service. It is a shame, then, that you aren't provided this service via their official channels, and have to resort to writing a review on Trustpilot. Bumped up a star from my original review.I ordered an RM850x PSU on the 27th of April - just like many other reviewers state, Corsair took the payment straight away, and have left my order 'In Process' since then.I made an inquiry on the 11th of May, and finally got a response on the 18th saying they had 'submitted (my) request with the Webstore department' - still nothing back since then.The PSU was 'in stock' when I placed the order, then changed to 'available in 1 to 2 weeks' soon afterwards, and as of about a week ago is now completely 'out of stock'. But I didn't receive a single notification about any of these developments.I decided to buy elsewhere and cancelled my order on the 19th, but that also requires requesting ticket - they haven't even sent or prepared anything for me yet, why should I have to wait for a refund? Unsurprisingly, still no response for that to-date either.This request/ticket system is a farce. I realise that times are tough, but this really is quite a poor service.If any of the Corsair team members see this post, I'd be appreciative if you could help move along my refund request, thank you.Ticket number - 2001202349 Order number - 4000203968",Hello Jam.

I finally got on the phone with a support agent all to be told the same things that so many others have been told. My order is at a facility waiting to be picked up by a courier and that that should be done within the week, so we're looking at about a 12-14 day range for shipping.

I think that once they can sort out the backlog of orders then things should start rolling through a bit smoother with getting tracking info etc.I recently purchased a new chair from their website on Sunday as I need a new one for my setup and checked it out earlier to see if there has been any tracking info added and apparently it's been shipped fairly quickly and is now just down to the waiting game for when it will arrive at my house. Overall for the speed at which I bought the chair itself and the time it took for me to recieve the tracking info after it was recieved I will have to give it a thumbs up. It may be different for other products depending on where they're shipping from and how many and on order etc. as PSU units seem to be the top purchase currently.

528,"May 15, 2020",5,United States,"Shipping Status? I ordered a power supply on May 11th and haven't received any info on when I can expect it to ship. All my other computer parts have either arrived already or are being shipped right now. Based on some of the other reviews, I'm concerned that unless it gets brought up here, I can't expect an update from Corsair at a reasonable time.I'll wait another day or two, but if I don't get some sort of update on when the PSU will ship, I'll probably just cancel my order and order somewhere else. I'll change my review though if we're able to get this all sorted out. My order number is 4000223433.Edit: Received a quick response from Corsair which is nice. Having the PSU arrive on the 18th is definitely very reasonable. Didn't receive a tracking number which had me concerned initially. I was able to find my tracking info on UPS through tracking via reference number, a.k.a my order number. A bit more complicated then necessary I feel, but I'm glad to see that my package did get shipped.Edit 2: I've decided to change my rating to 5 stars. The product looks to be in excellent condition and it arrived in a timely manner. The only issue I had was never receiving some sort of shipping number which made me believe my item was just sitting there, when in reality, it was already shipped. Overall I'm still satisfied with Corsair, and I think I was a little too quick to jump the gun on assuming the worst.","Hello Rnomadrs. Apologies for the delay. Your power supply has shipped.

558,"March 26, 2020",1,Great Britain,"Faulty Corsair PSU RM750 I brought a Corsair PSU RM750, within a few days of having it it made a loud bang and stopped working. I narrowed down the problem to the PSU by testing my desktop with another. I informed this to corsair customer support and it took them a few days to email me a conformation of what the next steps were. They informed me that they wanted me to send back this faulty PSU to the warehouse at my expense. I don't even see the necessity for me to send it back since for them to make it would only be a few £'s. But more importantly why should I pay for tracked delivery of an item that weighs over 2kg at my expense. I informed them of the The Consumer Rights Act 2015 and they eventually sent me a DHL pre paid delivery. I reluctantly sent it back even though this is not essential during an epidemic lockdown in London. Once I sent it, it took a week to receive a response email on my situation. They informed me that they would send me a follow up email with the delivery of the replacement and once I received that it would be 3-5 days. This means that at best I would receive this new part the end of next week. This is completely ridiculous why a faulty part which I hadn't even had 30 days is taking a month to be resolved. The day before London went into all but essential lockdown I went to PC world and brought a new PSU which although was slightly less watts and more expensive than my previous it was better than nothing.I informed them today that unless they can give me next day shipping for Friday 26th of March then I would like to reimbursed the cost of the new item I had to buy due to their failure. They have given me no update on the situation and left me on hold for half an hour. I have given up calling. The worst customer service I had ever experienced.Case number 2001075194","Hello Eloisa.

559,"March 23, 2020",4,Great Britain,"Dissapointed with Corsairs protocols rather than their producs Wow, I was blown away on how many bad reviews there are for Corsair, however, I only build a new computer every 6 years or so and in my mind Corsair were a must have component source from previous experience - and no failures at all.. (If I had read the reviews first I would have swapped supplier and not took a chance on Corsair)However, my ultimate build included a number of Corsair items, The Icue 465 Case - with three LL120 fans, Purchased an additional 3 LL120 fans too, The 360mm AIO cooler, 32Gb (2x16Gb) Dominator DDR4 Ram, 850 Gold Power supply unit - so a tad over £500.Meticulous with my builds and spent hours on the cables trying to hide everything and also making it look super tidy even around the power supply unit and back of case which isn't visible once the computer is up and running, spent more hours on cables than I did putting all the parts together and overclocking it - I'm a perfectionist. (though some may say OCD)My computer is fantastic, however, whilst finishing the final setting on the overclocking 5 of the LL120 fans ceased to illuminate, still spinning OK though, So initially I swapped the Icue node with the one I received as part of the three additional fan kit - still the same - so swapped it back, eventually it dawned on me that perhaps like Christmas tree lights when one set of LEDs fail the others later in the line may also fail, so I unplugged fan 2 and just moved all the other fans up on the node - and hey presto all working fine.Impatience and not being able to wait for a replacement from Corsair I decided to order via Amazon a single LL120 so my build was perfect, It arrived the very next day and I'm super chuffed with my super fast all singing and dancing computer.Later I thought I would contact Corsair and tell them one of the LL120s that came with the case had failed and hoped they would replace it (It would be a spare part) - and then the drama stated.Emailed Corsair, nice fellow Tom replied, can I have your purchase receipt - fair enough, The small square packing note which identified the date, the price, the 465 case etc - So I scanned it and PDF it, replied to Tom and attached the PDF.Next - another mail - it has to be the receipt, so more timewasting - onto Amazon and downloaded the full receipt of all my parts I ordered and printed it, then back to the scanner to save the scan as a PDF, saved to the computer and once again sent another mail to Tom with full receipt as PDF attached.Then, two mails from Corsair - one from Tom saying they will swap the faulty fan out once I've returned it to them, pack it up, print the return label, take to post office, send - and when they get it a few days later they will send a replacement.The second email asked for the complete purchase to be returned - so that would be my case - after stripping it down and wrecking my cabling - Not a chance - this is a £20 retail fan - so to Corsair maybe £3 and for something of such low value they wanted me to jump through hoops, not have a working computer for weeks and send the whole case back.I told them I'm not going to bother as its a low cost item, their reply? - Fine, I will close the case.So, I'm more disappointed with Corsair as a company rather than corsair products (all manufacturers make some faulty products) or perhaps a little naïve - I expected them to simply post me a fan with compliments - come on Corsair - you can do better.","Hello Glyn.

Part 2I had problems with both my dads Corsair memory and my own Corsair cooler. For the cooler which was all I could deal with myself the first rep told me flat out I wasn’t getting warranty support as I was not the original purchaser even though the cooler had 3 years of warranty left and I had all original paperwork including invoices. After my review on here they got in touch and things went much better. They made an exception for me as the cooler shouldn’t have failed so early and as I had the invoices and paperwork. DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU as my case was quite unique. It states in the warranty booklet that warranty is not transferable, which I still believe is wrong but I also believe people on eBay buying second hand need to be aware of this, which is why the new review stands. Currently I have my refurbished brown boxed cooler and is again working but time will tell how long for, however my dads ram got replaced with a quality replacement so he is happy with this and so am I. It seems the initial contact point for Corsair was the weak point because the service I received after the initial refusal has been stellar. I’m upgrading this review to 5 stars.","Hello.

I logged on because I am building a system for a loved one for whom this Corsair solution was her ONLY choice. So I purchased some things for her - each requiring additional purchases.. Corsair has milking it down to a science... Literally the cables they omit from a Power Supply offering to fans in cases etc. so I came here seeking help thinking that my problem might simply just require 20$ more to solve, which at this point in the ordeal I was willing to do. So I created an account, click subsequent activation link and then even posted a few times yesterday on the forums. Later yesterday afternoon I returned home to add something to the forum post and it spat back that my password was incorrect, which was odd since I saved it into the browser I was using, but none the less I entered it manually.. Wrong - Password incorrect. I am now at 2 of 5 logins and access will be disabled for 15 minutes. I am trying to get RGB working not access social security account data right? but anyway. I click on the reset password link, I enter my email address and it emails me my username and password and a link to change my password, which I click on and then proceed to enter the provided  username and password information in the fields - WRONG - I have now used 3 of 5 login attempts and will be locked out. So I call the 800 number and listen to 7 options before being offered ' for help with your online account' I push it and wait 5 or 8 minutes whatever not a long time but not short either and nice gentleman answers the phone and upon describing my issue to him he PUTS ME ON HOLD for another 10 minutes, returns to tell me he has sent an email to another person and should take a couple hours for a response and he will get back to me -Seriously?  Password reset? /facepalmHere is the bottom line: The instructions provided on all your RGB equipment is WOEFully lacking to put the best face on it really. A schematic of how the whole deal works. 3 maybe 4 Bullet points and links to detail explanations of the system maybe should just come with the product? But then seeking support from your company was just sunk time wasted in frustration.  Once I discovered the schematic - just a basic picture someone posted, I was all set and on my way. Then later someone else responded I think via Amazon questions I had posted prior to buying with a link to an Aussie fella that confirmed everything the schematic said - EXCEPT that the Corsair Crystal X570 se Case's power supply shroud and front bottom button light bling need to be last on the HUB controller. Not 6 but last, as in 3 fans 1 2 3 , Shroud 4, Want to ad fans? this gets moved to the end of the chain as nothing will work on the other side of it. all of this could fit on like 3 pages. just sayin...and I am now thinking.. what would happen if I added a hub? Would that shroud then need always to be at the very end of the chain no matter the length? In the end though - a schematic and a few simple words in each products package on a paper taped to the case with PLEASE READ? It didn't take too long to TS the shroud issue and ended up forcing me to re-cable manage everything, so some good came of it I suppose. The original install would have taken 20 minutes maybe if the instructions didn't SUCK though... <---",Hello. Our apologies with the difficulty in accessing your forum account.

I heard back and received a shipping label,  Items were shipped and delivered, and I'm waiting for Corsair to analyze.  The claim people I'm now communicating with are more clear and responsive than initial customer support.Original review with a response to Corsair's post at the end:I've used Corsair power supplies and rams for many years and the parts always outlived the computers they were in.  The 5 star product quality is the only reason I'm not giving this review 1 star or lower.  I finally had a Corsair power supply die with a loud pop.  It was 8 months old with a 7 year warranty.  Customer support said it may have damaged other parts in my system.   Since I'm not able to test my computer without a power supply, customer support said I should send my computer in for failure analysis because if I got just a replacement power supply I couldn't claim additional damage later.  I've had power supplies go dead in the past with no additional damage, but never suddenly with a loud pop, so I followed their advice and filled out the damage claim form and supplied all receipts and photos as specified in order to submit my pc for failure analysis.  I submitted the claim to the specified email on 9/30/19 and have not been able to get any update or response from Corsair since then.  My emails aren't answered.  If I call, I'm put on hold, then told the ticket has been escalated and someone would get back to me that day, but no one ever does.  Two weeks without a single update, question, or communication of any sort.  Corsair products are good, but if you do have a product go bad, customer support appears to be non-existent.  Buyer beware. (Ticket #2000852468)Response to reply from Corsair:  Thanks for your reply.  However, the last email I got from Corsair was on Oct 4.

599,"October 03, 2019",1,Suriname,"Corsair sent my product out anyway, 12 days after cancellation. I recently ordered the Corsair 1000D. Upon further research I decided against it. Figuring the case would take 2 weeks to even ship due to availability. I filed an order to cancel it. It took 6 days before they even opened my ticket yet it took no time at all to withdraw the money in my account. Once filed, they said, ""They'd look into it"" yet another 6 days go by. I get on to check the status of my cancellation. It then said shipped and had NO TRACKING information. Several calls later they say it shipped just moments ago yet 12 days before I was fighting to cancel it. It seems like Corsair is so desperate for money they'd rather force the shipment than cancel my order. Now they want to hold my money until I deny the package from whatever delivery service they use(because they never once sent me tracking information) and then after it comes back they will return my money. This is atrocious. It should have taken no time at all to hit cancel and return the money. Most companies do it in less than 30 minutes. I know it is partially on me for ordering it and having second guesses, but the 12 days after I filed the cancellation is absolutely incredible. Needless to say once this mess gets cleaned up, which I have no hope for Corsair because they're mindless, I will never order another product again. The lack of timely support is awful.

I placed an order for the obsidian 500d rgb se case on the 25th of September. I called at 10am PCT. I noticed my email had regular 3-5 day shipping, but I selected 1-3 day shipping. My invoice on the site had the expedited shipping but the final price didn't add up. I called and spoke to someone and they sent me an email to reply with a screenshot of what was on my account. The told me that it will be expedited shipped and someone will call me back so we could make things work since it was a glitch in the system.Flash forward to around 630 EST. And I called them back. Explaining that no one called or collection of the $25 had been done. I asked to very since it getting close to end of day for west coast, that my shipment will be done that day with expedited shipping and how can I pay the $25. The new rep told me he was contacting that department and if we couldn't get things done i would need to cancel and reorder. I informed him that i placed the case in the cart and selected shipping and its showing the same amount. I told him it's some kind of glitch. I stayed on the phone on hold to see if it could get fixed. He came back and said he'll have to email me because they haven't responded yet and it could take about 30 minutes.  I agreed to get off the phone and wait for the email.So I get a email right at corsair closing time that explains that it hasn't been fixed and if not tonight, then tomorrow the issue will be resolved. I replied that I am hoping to have everything this weekend, and to please tell me if I should just cancel and reorder to get it over weekend. No response. I call and their closed. I login my account and the item now has a tracking number. It's a link and not showing up in the carrier system. Now I'm upset. He could have kept his work and let me know to cancel so I could reorder with the faster shipping.  He could have responded that it was already shipped. Just nothing, no response?45 minutes later the item is in the carrier with shipment information.  I wont receive the item until Tuesday. So I have to wait till the following weekend to build instead of this weekend.  I expired everything in a $4k build to get it done this weekend.  I explained it to 2 reps.

I remember when my HDD cage failed for my SPEC-03 case and I was sent a new HDD case in no time. I even once opened a ticket regarding missing two key caps (totally my fault) and they still decided to come through and send them in snail mail. That was one of the best customer experiences ever. However....Things changed. Now I can't even get through to Corsair. The only way to get to them is through Skype if you're not in the US. Wait time is horrible, unless you call right away 8.00 am in the morning Pacific Time.I managed to get through to them as soon as they opened the customer support lines. I told them the following: I have this power supply that I bought 2nd hand HX1200i (which is understandable that warranty is not covered if it's 2nd hand). It's working fine apart from the USB that connects to iCUE to see wattage, fan speed etc. It's literally a plastic cap that's missing (it just fell off) and I was using the original included cable.1st time I called Corsair: I was told that I cannot claim warranty, I told them contacting the original owner is impossible as I have bought it over a year ago and even though I have the invoice I still couldn't claim warranty (which I get). However, I literally wanted to buy warranty to have this fixed... Not possible apparently. Paying for repair? Also not possible. I said okay, and goodbye.2nd time I called Corsair: I told them right away what the issue is, I told them that power supply is second hand and I understand that I can't claim warranty but I asked again to see if I can purchase warranty or ask for repair service perhaps. Not possible. I literally asked, I might as well bin the PSU since it's now useless (I really need to monitor my wattage because the system is eating LOTS of W, I just don't want my bills to be huge). The agent I spoke to said yes, I might as well bin it (in a nicer way but the message still stands). After spending over £200 for a power supply, I am unable to even use it properly and I can't buy warranty or have it fixed even though I wanted to pay for it!This is truly disgraceful, and I will not be buying or supporting Corsair any longer. Seems like buying from the likes of EVGA which is confident in their products and warranties is the way to go. I own the following:- 16x ML120 Pro Red fans- 3x Commander Pro- K70 LUX Keyboard- VOID RGB Headset- Vengeance 1500 Headset- HX1200i- 64GB of Vengeance Red Led DDR4 3200Mhz- Custom red sleeved cables for HX1200i- I also owned 2x H115i AIOsIt's safe to say that once these things stop working, they will be binned and replaced by more reputable brand, who is confident in their products and is willing to provide support in Europe and other continents without having to call US and struggle, not to mention nothing is resolved and I am out a PSU because of a stupid defect.I will definitely warn friends and relatives about this.Stay away and save yourself hassle.

My case with them is about a case where the motherboard distances did get loose after I screwed it on and then it is not rescrewable and then they are accusing me from damaging it myself, how did I do that when all I did was just screwing the mobo on and the distance starts to screw itself off and then I can't get it back to place. After and after I try to explain about this and all I get is pathetical answer that is my fault and problem and that they will not do anything at all to help me.

The ones I noted above have ALWAYS tried to help me as well as they can, try to fix problems even if not covered by warranty but Corsair they just refuses because they have no ""obligation"" to help me with the problem. I have to say I'm very disappointed with the support on Corsair and I would never in my life buy a product from this company unless they provide me with a solution on this quality issue.

Avoid this and buy a NZXT product if you for example want a case, because how are you going to start your computer when the start button doesn't work. Corsair won't help you, they will tell you it's your fault and ""wear is not covered by warranty"".

611,"August 20, 2019",1,United States,"Horrible customer support I have been a consumer of Corsair products for years and have no issues at all. My latest build showed some signs that needed addressed. I build a tower, using a Corsair Crystal Series 460X. I love the case and have nothing bad to say. The case came stock with three SP120 RGB LED cooling fans. I added an extra, in the rear. Over time, I found that two of the fan would make a horrible noise and would slow. This would happen after cold boot. I could get them to quiet down by a reboot or two or letting them calm down or a quick blast of duster to ensure it was not dust build up. But, I would say I needed to look at RMA as the warranty period was running out. I then went to the support site, entered the RMA. It took over four days and a request to archive the RMA, due to lack of communications, to create a new RMA to get traction. Needless to say, I was contacted. I was then asked to provide proof of purchase, which I did, and nothing. A couple days went by, no response. I then went to the user forums, asking if anyone else has issues with delays. I was responded to, promptly, stating they would investigate. Within twenty-four hours, I was asked to provide a video of the issue. I explained that I didn't have most problematic fan installed any longer and didn't know when the other fan would act up. I was told I would have to prove they are failing. I have ran RMA's with other products before with other companies. I have never had to prove a problem existed with a video. I have an open question, pending, currently. But I don't expect a response until I pester the case owner of go back to the user forums or Reddit. That is completely unacceptable, to have to use a user forum or Reddit to get a response from support. I would hope, that I am the odd man out. And that this is not a recurring issue. But after reading stories of other consumers, I would say no, I am not the odd man out, that customer service with Corsair is very lacking. How can I contemplate another purchase if they will not stand behind their product, in regard to the RMA process. I shouldn't have to fight for it.","Hello,I'm sorry for the experience you've had dealing with us so far.  Can I possibly get your ticket number?

622,"July 19, 2019",3,Lithuania,"3 out of 4 products faulty, 2 of those are critical defects. Support quality is underwhelming It's safe to say I will not take this brand seriously anymore.I had 4 products: A Keyboard (RBG K70) and 3 different AX860i PSUs (2 bought and 1 replacement). In case you are not aware, the keyboard is roghly 150-180 euros and the PSU is 190-230 euros.Similar RGB keyboards can be found for about 80 euros and similar PSUs (ignoring the budget versions) are around 120-180. I thought premium price = premium quality (as it usually is with other brands)....Update: Although it took over 2 weeks since i requested a refund/replacement for the last unit, they agreed to a refund and covered the postage.RGB keyboard flickers in full color mode (apparently it's not considered a defect and is an issue that is present on every keyboard).1 of the PSUs worked flawlessly for about 2 years until I sold with along with PC it was in. I got another one of those PSUs and It developed progressively more frequent crashes (it's a nightmare to find out what causes them). I got it replaced and the replacement for that one died within 3 months.Normally, I would expect some amount of defects but 3 out 4 products being faulty is kind of high. To top that off Corsair doesn't seem to take them too seriously either. I didn't pursue any action with keyboard, because the problematic mode can be disabled. PSUs are another story. I asked for a replacement, got offered 2 inferior products as replacements (both about 25-30% cheaper on amazon) because the product I bought was out of stock. I said unless they want to upgrade it to higher version of the same model I would wait for original (I had to say it twice, because the 2nd replacement offer came after I sent a message saying I want the product I bought and not a downgraded version). The 3rd time they said ""[product code] is not available"" and offered me a refurbished the same PSU. I was stupid enough to accept it, still expecting a ""Premium"" standard, but the refurbished PSU lasted about 3 months. I asked for another replacement or (preferably) refund, but support has not responded at all in over a week (no Holidays in this week). I will not go as far as to say that it has been the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I experienced much worse support with other brands, but it's definitely not what I expect from a huge brand on premium products.

628,"July 14, 2019",1,Argentina,"Alright Alright, this will be a long-ish but, I believe, fair review of the Corsair Brand.  Preface, I've been interested in computer gaming and hardware for a while as they both overlap with my professional field (video/audio editing). I have also owned over the span of 15+ years components from all major brands, Razer, Logitech, Kingston, Corsair and many others.When it comes to Corsair specifically I can say that their memory modules and power supply units are outstanding and I can recommend them thoroughly, but PURELY from a hardware point of view.My one-star review is related to two major areas of the company.1) Keyboards.2) Customer support.When it comes to keyboards, I have owned both a K95 ""RGB"" (the one with the outrageous amount of macro buttons). And a K70Lux, from which I am typing this review.Both of these keyboards have had their RGB LEDs fail in the most annoying and disheartening way, here's what I mean, each LED has three sub-LEDs, one red, one green and one blue, and those can fail individually and they did so on my sample, you can test this out on you RGB keyboard by setting all the lights to pure white, if a sub-led is failing you will not see pure white light but a variation thereof.This failure was particularly unnerving because it happened (In both instances mind you) a few months after the warranty period had expired. This effectively removes the ""RGB"" element from the keyboard as you now cant use some colors, which is the whole point of buying an RGB keyboard in the first place.And while I do understand that no hardware will last forever, having main components fail a few months after the warranty period is unacceptable to me, particularly when a cursory google search reports many, MANY other users with the exact same problems. Which leads me to number...2) Customer support. I've only very briefly dealt with customer support over forums but again, anecdotal evidence easily available with a google search turns up results that paint the support experience as extremely poor, in most cases, people get no response or a severely delayed and the best way to get customer support to actually DO something is to make a big deal out of it in forums and message boards, only then, apparently will a rep come in to, very publicly, help you out and let everyone know what a good company Corsair is...I've recently had another customer support experience, with Kingston my hyperX headphones were getting worn out, more specifically the earpads, I sent an email to them and they promptly replied asking for my info, and a few weeks later I had the replacements free of charge delivered to my doorstep. Keep in mind both that they were out of warranty and that I live outside of the USA, so they were extra helpful and went somewhat above and beyond for me. In closing, Corsair makes some decent products, but I would steer clear of their peripherals and if you do decide to buy from them, have no illusions about them putting the customer first.EDIT: Replying to corsair. I have tried everything under the moon and more, flashing back, flashing beta versions, tried it on different PCs, and so on (I even tried a Linux distro and reinstalled windows just in case), naturally, none of it helped since this is clearly NOT a software issue. It amazes me that you would even suggest that it is when your boards (and let's be honest here, maybe some other manufacturer's too) have well documented LED soldering issues.Honestly, your reply seems formulaic and pretty much reads like underestimating your customers is common practice.","Hello,I do apologize for the troubles you’ve had with our products.

Call #13 was the first time that anyone bothered to pick up the phone. Every other attempt was met with 30 minutes on hold and then having the automated system hang up on me. The one ""successful"" call still proved ineffectual as there has been no follow-ups or forward progress in the four days since. I WAS able to get an email response after the first two weeks of submitting a support ticket online, but the projected ship date I was given has been overshot by nearly two weeks.By far the WORST purchase experience I have ever had. I'd rate a 0 star if I could. I will not be doing any future business with Corsair and will be warning anybody within earshot to avoid them at all costs.","Hello, I want to apologize for the poor experience you've had with us.

633,"July 09, 2019",1,Svalbard,"After recommending Corsair to customers… After recommending Corsair to customers for over a decade, I'm very sorry to say that I will no longer do so. When Corsair ventured to start producing more than just RAM, I believe that this would mark a downturn in the companies attention to quality and customer service. I was proven wrong in the past. However, that opinion has changed in the last month. I purchased a Corsair Lapdog when I moved so that I could use my PC from my couch and still have a decent experience. This was November 2018. I enjoyed the product up until last month when the USB cable began to fail. I believe this is an inherent flaw with having a heavy cable leveraged on a standard USB type A end. But this is an overlookable flaw. I message Corsair support with a simple request, I would simply like to purchase a new cable. After two weeks of waiting, I get a response that simply asks for my name and address, as well as a copy of the invoice. I provide this information, and the next email contains an RMA, and states shipping is to be done at the customer's expense. I was a little hesitant to send the product back, and pay $30-50 in shipping over a USB cable. I express my displeasure in this solution. Today, nearly another two weeks later, I get 2 emails containing a new tracking label for the RMA, another with the RMA process again, and a 4th accompanying email stating that Corsair had approved the RMA for a refund, as they were out of stock of the unit and did not have replacement parts. I'm very glad that I held off on shipping the product back at this point. I would have been paying $30-50 for a $79.99 refund... That would have been handled how? Who knows. It certainly couldn't be handled by refunding it to the card that was used for the purchase, or even the account.Either way, with the time it took to get a response on this, and the ""support"" provided, I'm steering clear of all Corsair products in the future.

634,"July 08, 2019",1,United States,"Nonexistant service from a company that CLEARLY doesn't care. Absolutely abhorrent. Not only are the wait times ridiculous for simple things, like getting a single shipping label, but they constantly pretend to care when in fact they drop you as soon as they believe they've lost your services.I've been nothing but polite and understanding throughout, yet it's been two months, and my accepted RMA for a faulty mouse has gone NOWHERE. They even tried to pass off a refurbished and already BROKEN unit as a replacement and further wasted my time after I sent them my faulty out-of-box unit. That's three broken or non-working mice IN A ROW. I can only assume that the rest of their hardware is just as poor in quality, since they seem very apprehensive to fix my issue. Last I heard from them is nineteen days ago, as they've employed the strategy of simply ignoring me at this point.I regret not doing my research on the horrible M65 RGB mouse, or Corsair's god AWFUL reputation with customer service, else I would have never wasted my money on their products. All I can do now is attempt to steer anyone away from them so they don't get scammed as well. If you're reading this and wondering why Corsair, a supposedly decent tech company, gets a bad rap, well. Do not put yourself through the headache. They do not care. If you DO end up buying a Corsair product, pray it doesn't break, or just bring it back to the store you got it from. Customer Service WILL NOT help you.I would have been more accepting if things still took time, and they kept you in the loop and updated, but two months with very little information and nineteen straight days of silence is inexcusable.EDIT: I've already been offered 'help' after posting on Corsair's Reddit page as well. That also got me nowhere, after a Corsair 'representative' said they would try and look in to the issue.All that's happened since then was a robotic post apologizing for the trouble, the ticket getting further ignored, and then closed to be re-opened under a different number. Now they want more pictures (of the product invoice they KNOWINGLY SHIPPED BROKEN) that I can't provide because I'm out of country for another three weeks.But hey, if you want to offer fake help as well, knock yourself out.

Pros: Honestly the case is absolutely stunning and based on previous feedback it appears that they have redesigned it adding various changes from the previous models.-great cable management ability-awesome glass-great dust filters on intakesCons: BEWARE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE! Also be aware of their quality control. I received the case with nothing broken so I had about 75% of the PC built. I was about to put in the liquid cooler up top and realized they didn’t put a top fan tray in the case. Well my first thought was eh no big deal I’ll just give them a call and I’m sure since they are a reputable company they should just send one out with the screws needed that same day.  Couldn’t get anyone to answer the phone and kept being disconnected but after 5 tries and 1.5 hours later I spoke to someone who said I needed to fill out a report on their website. Turns out getting any kind of parts from Corsair is worse then dealing with your local DMV. So many hoops to jump through and the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing. After multiple follow up phone calls I’m still waiting on the parts to arrive. I also asked if they were going to expedite the parts to me since this was their mistake and the person on the phone said “we ship standard ground service”. As if a small upper fan tray and 2 screws would cost SOOOOO much to ship expedited. Nope it’s shipping via UPS grounds. So even when Corsair makes the mistake the customer still pays with their time and aggravation but hey at least they got their money. Completely not ok for a major company who could have kept a customer happy by making them feel like a priority.  I just can’t understand how quality control can just let products go out the door with missing parts. It’s one thing to make a mistake but to not rectify the situation immediately is terribly unacceptable. After this experience and reading the reviews on BBB site as well as various other sites I will not be purchasing any other Corsair products for any of my gaming PC’s. There are far better companies that treat their customers better with far superior customer service and as equal if not better quality. Never think like me “Corsair? That’s major brand I trust since they have been around so long”.

Corsair does not care about their customer's experience when they deal with them. If they did, there would not be a litany of people on this forum describing the lengthy delays in responses. They would not have an employee like James who gives their customer empty platitudes. In fact, James' platitudes only serve as a great segue into my next point.2. Corsair does not do what they state they will. Example a) sending automated responses about how your ticket will be responded to within two days (consistently false).

653,"June 03, 2019",1,Great Britain,"Lying, thieving and never to be trusted. Ticket # 895613Had an essay written up before, due to a lot happening. So I'll try and shrink it down to a minute or two of reading time.Corsair falsely advertised compatibility of their RGB RAM. Once I provided proof and showed the CS worker that he was wrong and that it was advertised as compatibility with X99. They offered me any mouse of my choosing which was generous but not what I was wanting. All I wanted was a fix. Never wanted no RMA or free items. This got prolonged for about a week and then I gave up and gave in to their offer of the mouse and a RMA. Got sent to the refund team where things just went from bad to a lot worse. Because of their false advertising and them persistently pushing the RMA. I figured the least they could do is send the refund, so I could get replacement RAM and then ship their RAM back off to them. This wasn't happening, and I got accused of potentially stealing from them if they did such. So that was great, They screwed up and I am the thief? Right-o. So this went on for a few weeks and I gave in. They sent the prepaid label to print off but it was for the wrong weight, they send another prepaid label where the weight is plenty, but now the destination is to a completely different country, which was quite honestly a jerk move and they couldn't answer me as to why this happened. I was told due to this, once the RAM was collected, a refund would get started. 3 days later, I chase up where this refund is, and I am told due to them not having the RAM at the destination, they can't issue me with a refund, so up to now. I had been accused of being a thief and lied to. The refund took a week via PayPal to get to me, after they finally got the RAM. Ah also after I had already replaced the RAM with some cheapo 2nd hand stuff to keep me going for a bit and they had already given me the label to print. This is where they get a specialist to try and help with sorting the compatibility issue out. Their infrastructure for customer service is super backwards.I tried making complaints against Justice of whom accused me of being a thief and who also lied to me, but got no where. Corsair don't want to accept blame and ignored all my attempts. I strongly urge anyone to avoid Corsair and if you must, avoid speaking with Justice and try and speak with another member of their CS team.","Dear Mr. Scantlebury, On behalf of Corsair, I want to apologize for the complications you’ve had with us. Our purpose is not to falsely advertise any of our products in anyway. This was a mistake on our end, and we have made the necessary corrections.In regards of the refund, I understand your concern. It’s a common practice for us to have the item returned before processing a refund. We don't mean to cause any inconvenience by this and hope you can understand. From what I can see, you've been working with Justice and are close to getting this resolved. In regards of the mouse, it looks like it was sent out 6/6, I will provide you the tracking number within the ticket.  We highly appreciate you taking the time and working with our team to troubleshoot the issue. It can be a lengthy process at times depending on the circumstances. We try and gather as much information as possible to prevent these types of errors in the future. In some cases, we may need someone else to handle the case as it exceeds one role.

After setting the pc up and installing my software programs and updating the graphics card it started having pixel-ated game play less than 2 weeks later and then no graphics at all and CMOS reset did not resolve issue. They replaced the unit and the customer service for that situation was not that bad at all. Fast forward to March 2019 and the system did the same thing - again this was shortly after an NVIDIA update. They replied asking if I wanted to replace or repair the unit. I selected repair this time. I was under the impression from many online reviews from tech related sources that these systems were better than this. I am still waiting for the return box or tracking info for the return box. They are taking their sweet time. I will not purchase another Corsair. They really should enable reviews for customers on their website, it would be way more transparent to the issues they are having.

It was not on the SSD that was on the bottom of the mini tower. After contacting support the data is on a drive attached to the motherboard if it was not on the other removable SSD, and accessing it will void warranty. The data auto default to saved to the MB drive so I am unable to retrieve my data unfortunately. As I was not thinking my 2nd new unit from Corsair would be having a similar issue, I did not back it up like I should have. That is my mistake - note to self and everyone else: make sure your data is on the removable SSD, so when it has an issue (not IF) you will be able to access your data still. I am sad for this but I have hopes my repaired Corsair will last longer than 6 months the third time.UPDATE on 04-19-19I appreciate that Justice is also helping with this frustrating situation since it is the 2nd time this has occurred to my Corsair One since purchasing it.

Because the purchase was from newegg.com (US) I contacted Corsair and to try to sort it out here in the UK. Corsair responded and said that it's not a problem, just to send all 4 memory modules back before they can send me a replacement (in 2-3 days), they also offered to do an Advance RMA where they send me the memory first and then I send the faulty one, but that would require me to pay for the new memory upfront (4-500 quid) and later they would refund me once they receive the faulty kit. Why should I pay another 500 quid ? to get a replacement for a product that is faulty from the factory?Anyway... I decided to just send the faulty memory kit and wait for a replacement. I did not want to risk another 500 quid with this company. Also, forgot to mention that I also had to pay for the shipment, no prepaid shipping label offered.So, now, 2 weeks since Corsair received the faulty memory kit and still no memory in my PC, not even on its way. They told me they don't have the memory on stock and they need to arrange a kit to be sent from Taiwan, they also offered me to go for an alternative replacement, instead of Corsair Dominator Platinium, to go with Corsair Vengence ....which is a cheaper model.

Step 2: Offer to the customer to do an Advance RMA and charge him for the second memory kit (even if temporary charge, basically renting my money for free).

I already had uninstalled and re-installed iCUE & update all drivers prior to contacting Live Chat and it did not fix the issue.  In fact, after updating to the latest driver, my mouse is worse off than it was before and nothing else improved.Do I need to open another ticket?I used the live chat to inquire about some issues I'm having with 3 of 4 Corsair peripherals.  I have VoidPro Wireless Headset, ST100 Headset Stand, Darkcore Wireless Mouse and K70 keyboard.  So far, I can say that this had been the worst customer care live chat I've ever experience.Couple of things I'm really disappointed with but 2 that clearly stood out:1) Live Chat does not provide a ticket number - You have to wait 1-2 business days (hopefully this is true) and they will issue the ticket number to your e-mail that provides troubleshooting.  Why does Corsair have one agent collect information so that someone else can create the ticket?  More so, why are they sending me trouble shooting via e-mail when there is a live chat agent? Very confusing... but I'm glad I came here first while in a long que waiting for live chat agent.  I was well prepared to be disappointed. 2) Live chat agent lacks professionalism - Other than the standard ""How can I help you?"" opener, don't expect them to inquire about your issues.  They don't seem to care about you or their job either.  When I asked whether I will be getting the ticket number on the live chat or via e-mail, the agent's was quick to reply with ""Yes"".  I am already frustrated enough with the problems with my Keyboard, Mouse and Headset Stand, I don't need anymore confusion from customer support.The reason I gave 2 stars is: 1st Star is for actually being connected to an agent.  2nd star is that I will be getting a ticket number (hopefully).

I logged my ticket for a faulty keyboard with Corsair on 02 December. After some back and forth correspondence (and a 3 - 5 day wait for Corsair to reply each time), they finally got round to sending a courier to collect the keyboard for RMA. This was on 02 Jan, 30 days after I logged my first ticket to report the fault. I sent a message to Corsair to advise the keyboard had left my possession. The keyboard arrived at the RMA centre in The Netherlands 2 days later. I sent Corsair a message on 07 Jan to advise that as per tracking, keyboard was received on 04 Jan. I've not had a reply from Corsair since. No acknowledgement, no update, nothing. I sent a follow-up on 13 Jan, no surprise here, still no reply. It has now been 44 days since I started this process, with no end in sight it seems. I'm still without a keyboard and had to purchase a new one to tie me over since they are taking so long and I need it for work purposes. Seriously Corsair? This is how you conduct business?

Thanks, Justice.They have decent products, but you want to hope you never have to deal with their customer service department.My keyboard failed recently and I'm getting a usb drive when I plug it in now.

I sent a request asking for those files and there hasn't been any response asking me for any other information (if needed). Luckily I have a spare I can use in the meantime, but I just want my colorful lights back.It's pretty bad when you have to leave a negative review on a 3rd party site just to get attention on a service ticket. If your support site says I'll get a response in 1-2 business days, I expect a response in 1-2 business days. Sure, my ticket ""only"" has been waiting for a week, but that is already unacceptable.

My cpu suddenly started overheating when turned on, going from 70c up to as high as 104c.  This has left me with a computer that throttles itself badly at best and at worst crashes, and of which is therefore currently unusable.So, on 12/26/2018 I opened a ticket: #828790.  Right away they made me wait at their convenience, while they enjoyed the holidays, taking double their normal and already slow waiting time of 2 business days.  Taking more than seven total days to reply while I was without my pc.  Strike 1.Then, responding as though they are paid by the word, I got two short statements telling me that somehow I was supposed to know to attach proof of purchase and the serial number of the part to the ticket.  This was not made clear by their horrible way overly busy and convoluted website and ticket system. This is information that should have been clearly relayed to me and easily taken care of automatically as part of the ticket opening process, or with an quick small manual response, but was not.  This delayed the process another 24 hours.  Strike 2.After this we went back and forth twice, once per 24 hours, with Corsair being uncooperative.  Finally, I got 2 full vague sentences about my clear professional itemized receipt for my pc being for ""a completely different item"".  Keep in mind that this whole time Corsair support was cold, disrespectful of my time and showed no compassion or appreciation for my situation, and never apologized for any trouble I was being caused by the part failure, or this process. Strike 3.I was then forced to call customer support directly to try to get this situation resolved.  The call actually seemed to go decently.  The man on the other end actually seemed to be slightly understanding and apologetic finally, for once, if also somewhat disinterested.  He was only slightly helpful, updating my ticket with a small adjustment and situation clarification.  However, he could not directly help me and said that he would have to have the ticket escalated to a manager and that this would take 24 - 48 hours.It has now been over 48 hours (and 5 more days since the original response)  with absolutely no response and no resolution.  I am currently stuck with out access to my computer with no end in sight.  this unbelievable slow process continues to plod along with Corsair again disrespecting my time and treating me very poorly and slightly unprofessionally.I am strongly considering never doing business with Corsair again, and would recommend others against it as well.","Hi Jesse,I have no good excuse for the delay in response after you opened the ticket, we were just behind.

My option were to send the faulty ram back and a replacement would be sent once received or to use Express to receive a replacement first, however this would require a holding charge of £120 until the old ram was received. I questioned this as this was more than i paid for the ram in the first place and it seems unreasonable to expect me to pay out to receive replacement parts for faulty ones sold, they are not old, they have not been damaged, they were sold faulty. As i said, 10 days have now passed and no one has responded to my enquiry about the cost. They have removed the option to use Express since i last checked meaning i am now left only with the option to send the ram to them (at my expense) leaving me with no working PC in the meantime.They seem to care more about their image from reviews which was responded to quickly rather than actual customer service.

701,"December 10, 2018",1,Sudan,"Horrible experience, never buying from the Corsair website again. I recently purchased a few items from Corsair during their black friday sale. One of which was a Crystal series case. Now I bought it seperately from all the other items but decided I didn't want it and created a support ticket asking for cancellation before it was shipped. That was on the 26th of November. I received the item a week after that. I received a reply to the ticket today, the 10th of December. The response was ""I requested to cancel your order. We will notify you if we can still cancel your order. If you do have any concerns or questions please don't hesitate to contact us."" The case is still lying around and I decided to contact customer service to get this thing returned. I called +1 (888) 222 4346 and waited for exactly 15 minutes before giving up and continuing on to their Live Chat option. I waited for another 15 minutes there and was greeted by Bernard M. It was the most miserable customer support experience I've ever had. The highlight of it was after describing my support ticket issue he said ""we apologize for the delay"" which is what's normally expected. But then goes quiet for a few minutes before I finally ask ""May I have an update on what you're doing please? Are you checking the order? Seeing what my options are?"" If you guys keep the chat log, please read through it, it felt like Bernard just wanted this thing to end as fast as possible and move on from having to deal with a frustrated customer. I would happily provide you with the chat log. At the end he promised an email with a return address. It arrived right away. However I'm still waiting on the shipping label he requested from Corsair. I am utterly disappointed that a company that produces such amazing products to have such unacceptable customer service.","Hi,I really do apologize that 2 of our agents failed to properly review your case before responding to you via chat and ticket. It was obvious that you had already received the product when they told you they would cancel it. The delay was due to work volume in the holiday season, but there is no excuse for not just apologizing for the delay and giving you a proper update.It seems you are on the right track now, let me know if your shipping label has not arrived yet, it was requested.Hope you are well,Justice",<FreqDist with 4 samples and 4 outcomes>,<FreqDist with 2 samples and 2 outcomes>,0.9497

703,"December 04, 2018",1,Suriname,"two months and counting for a broken keycap ticket #790003A keycap broke on my k70 mechanical keyboard two months ago. After sending the receipt, and sending two messages in the interim, I got a response 8 days later that gave me a USPS tracking number. Ok, went to the USPS site, and the tracking number does not exist.15 days later, I sent a message saying that the tracking still did not work and that I had no package and got a response the next day saying the product WILL be sent (not HAS been sent) from TAIWAN (no wonder a USPS tracking number didn't work), and was given a tracking number (with no information about where I was supposed to be tracking it) and told it would be 10-13 days, not including ""customs processing work."" whatever that means.Two weeks later I inquired about this ""customs processing work"" step, wondering what impact it was having on my shipment. After no response after 5 days, I sent another messages outlining my frustration with both the long process and the seemingly intentional vagueness of the replies, and got a response 3 days later, simply giving me (finally, I guess) a link to Taiwan's postal tracking. I'm going to assume corsair knows this is another dead end, as the tracking drops off once it is shipped to the U.S., which IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE MAILING PROCESS. So, I'm looking at tracking that says it was sent to Chicago, and that's it.I've since sent 5 updates to my ticket asking to resolve this non-delivery and gotten no response. I called customer support and was told the issue would be elevated and they would figure out why I haven't gotten the part. There has been no update, and my questions about this elevation on the ticket have gone unanswered. I'm inclined to believe that customer support has written me off.I cannot use this keyboard with a missing keycap, it simply doesn't work. So I've been using the keyboard that I thought I retired (Glad I kept it). It has some unresponsive keys, but they work if you hit them the right way, which is a total hassle, but easier than typing without a keycap. I build myself new PCs and replace out parts on the regular, and recommend parts and do builds for family and friends, and corsair memory and cases are always one of my go-tos, as I've seen nothing but quality from them.  This practice is coming to an end.It's just a keycap. Seems such a silly thing to lose my loyalty and business over, but this is the worst customer service I've ever received from a computer parts company.EDIT: don't buy this PR business below. I got an update to my ticket  thanking me for my trustpilot ""reminder"" and promising to address the issue ""today"" ...three days ago. Since then: Radio silence and back to business (or lack thereof) as usual. This is a total joke.Edit 2: Dec. 10. After no updates to my ticket, I telephoned customer service number again today and finally made some headway with quick responses and unambiguous replies. I've been told the keycaps are out of stock, which makes me suspect that I was lied to about the shipments in the first place. They are now offering to RMA the entire keyboard. The very small amount of trust  that it takes to go through with an RMA is more than I have in this company at this point, but nonetheless, I'm having them do an advanced RMA and will update with results (or lack thereof).Edit 3 (1/23/19)15 days after taking Corsair took receipt of the returned keyboard, the money I put down on an express RMA has been refunded to my card. I will never buy a Corsair product for myself, or for others, again.","Hi Zach,I can see that your ticket has not been replied to.

704,"November 30, 2018",1,Senegal,"terrible customer service see pasted my forum post from the user forumsMain ticket #813557Original order #4000043242Shipping #1Z3X063E0310258585Let me start this off by saying this,I have always chosen Corsair for all of my peripherals(except for my current keyboard, I couldn't resist the 75% off sale a few years ago . Though I was planning on buying myself a k95 as well if I liked my brothers) and cases from the moment I started building Pc's for friends and family(and as of a few short years ago, building Pc's for customers around the globe averaging about 7-10 full builds a week). I have never once had to RMA or get a return/refund on a product from your company, and thus have never experienced the mess that has since unfolded infront of me.This year, after buying most of the parts for my brothers birthday(December 2nd) to build him a new computer, I found myself buying him the best of the best for his peripherals and went all out on black friday/cyber monday. While checking out with the keyboard(k95) at 12am,(the morning of 11/26/18) I must have unknowingly clicked on the k70 while comparing it between the k95. I was already in checkout for the k95 and could not see the k70 on my checkout page, so I went ahead and checked out. With no confirmation page for payment, I found myself paying close to 300 dollars for my 140 dollar purchase. Upon realization of this, I immediately opened a ticket(#813142) within the support system and went to bed.When I awoke, seeing no reply yet and not wanting my package to get sent out, I sent out a call to your phone support. I spoke to someone name Calvin(Kevin? not sure I couldn't understand through his thick accent) who guaranteed me that the k70 would not be sent out to me and sent out an email to shipping(presumably telling them to stop shipment of the package)and opened up a second ticket(#813325). Then hoping to hear back from him that day like he told me(he didn't), I assumed I would be given a refund after he got an email back. 11/26With things presumably settled, I went to work expecting a call back from Calvin. Halfway through work with no call back, I joined a live chat with Bernard M(which you can view the log of in the current ticket at the top of this post). With no clear solution for the problem and now increasily frustrated with not getting a definite answer of what happened and how I would get my money back and the keyboard I want, I called the phone support again after work.After being on hold for 15 minutes, I explained my frustration to the lady I was speaking to(too frustrated to make a mental note of her name)and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was placed on hold for another 10 minutes where I then spoke to Julie(I beleive the same person handling my ticket), who out of all the people I had spoke to was the first to tell my something useful and gave me a definite instruction to getting my problem resolved. She sent an email out to shipping and to the web store to get the k95 sent out and to get my refund processed. She requested that I did as Calvin recommended and refused delivery and RMAed the box. Being a bit more relieved, I ended the call with high hopes for the follow up email I would get with her.11/27The next morning, I went to work and told my brother that I had meant for the product to be shipped to my work address and to RMA it for me. He did, and around the same time he had texted me I received an update from Julie(see main ticket at top) and felt that I had finally started to recieve the customer service I expected your company to have.11/28I called to check in and was told by one of the outsourced phone operators that there was no update of either email. By 3pm both keyboards were returned to your warehouse and I had yet to receive a refund. I left it be and gave it another day11/29 (time of writing)Today I received another update from Julie who informed me that there was a delay in my shipment. Immediately angered, I called again and asked to speak to her. When I spoke to her, she informed me that due to the holidays I would not be receiving my keyboard just yet(even though i had both at my door 2 days ago). She also mentioned that the refund team had not gotten back to her and even though I now had no product, I would not be getting my refund anytime soon. Frustrated and worn down by what seems like a purposeful system to deter most RMA's to your company, I come here which seems to be the only place where things actually are taken care of. It is now 3 days till his birthday, and your company has lost the reputation in my eyes that it once had. Your customer service feels untrained and all of the ""Teams"" seem to not get back to each other in a fluid, timely manner. If I receive no shipping number or update on my ticket about my shipment and refund, I will be forced to get a refund through my bank, RMA the board you will ""eventually send due to the holidays"" and go out and buy him a keyboard with a company I know he will have no problem dealing with if there is an issue with the keyboard.Your customer service has turned me off from not only your company, but your products as well knowing that this is what my customers will have to deal with if they want to get something replaced under warranty or if I ever test and have to replace a defective cooler or RAM stick. My decision on which brands and products to bulk order the next time I need parts has been heavily impacted by the service your company has given.","Hi,I see you are dealing with my manager now in your ticket.

708,"November 08, 2018",1,Belgium,"Atrocious Customer Support 3 months ago one of my 2 x 8GB Vengeance Pro RAM broke. Since it was still on warranty period I made a ticket with Corsair's Support Portal. Got a relatively fast response to it, got it approved for shipment. First problem? The label given for DHL shipment didn't work. When I contacted DHL about they told me it's missing a crucial little detail, customer number (Corsair's customer number), so they can't invoice it, so no shipment for me. AWESOME. I had to call my local Corsair support (which BTW is in a neighbouring country, not even in my country - Belgium) to get a manually created shipping label emailed to me. That worked. Corsair received the defective RAM on 22nd September, nearly a month after it broke. Good start...Now, here comes the best bit. The RAM got approved for REFUND whilst you can still buy it from them on their own website, which means they have a stock of it. I got a refund, because well, ""they no longer have it in stock"". Nice one, Corsair. Unfortunately the refund has to be approved by the supervisor of the person who suggested it as a ""solution"" to my defective RAM problem. Of course it does, Corsair is playing a time game. Fine by me. I'm not giving up. That was the end of the story of my ticket on the Corsair Support website. It still has ""Processing"" status. We're 7 weeks later and well, the status hasn't changed to me, although since couple of last weeks I can only see the number and the status. It no longer takes me to the details of the ticket. I get an error site if I click it. Well designed system I must say.Here is where the fun begins. I employed my husband to help, he has more patience and speaks the language of the neighbouring country better than I do. I wanted to eliminate any mistakes that could be lost in translation, etc. The CS Representative who manually created the label and who we called the first time is the one behind this mess from what I gather. And the mess is just glorious. After the ticket got no more reactions online we started calling her for updates. Every week or so. It's been 6+ weeks now. Every time we hear she is working on it and it may take some time, we need to wait. Fine. Funnily enough according to her we can actually get my RAM replaced, I won't need a refund, but I have to wait. Even better, if you ask me. Maybe if there is no more of the same model I can even get a slight upgrade. Now, that would be something real nice, I think. And so I wait. In my time of waiting couple of things came to the surface. The lady went on holiday, so she couldn't help us. Okay, someone else is fine. The problem is, no one else knows ANYTHING about this RMA, it's not in the system. The phone number listed as CS on their website and that we call isn't even the RMA department, so we need to call RMA. We don't get forwarded, we have to call ourselves, at least they give us a phone number. We call RMA, RMA has NO CLUE what are we talking about, because the ticket in the system is cancelled. Not resolved, not processing, it's cancelled. Wow, that's a mess you have there, Corsair. So we call back the people of whatever department is listed on the CS website. I don't think they even know who they are themselves. A colleague of the lady picks up tells us he can't help us, because she has the details of the case, but she won't be back for another 10 days or so. LOVELY. I'll wait, Corsair, I'll wait. We called her time and time again, until today I was waiting. Today I learnt that she was ""very busy, because she has so much work"". Lady, I don't care. You had my RAM for weeks now, you had weeks to fix the mess you've made, so fix it already. She tells us to create another ticket to get more people on it. I'm sorry? YOU HAVE MY RAM, MAKE A TICKET YOURSELF. Husband got a bit tougher, but still politely told her she has time to Monday. It's not that difficult to find her manager's email, phone number, bah even Facebook if we must. Or the European manager details. Or the European Ombudsman. Well, Corsair, we have time, just like you do, but I'm done just waiting, Corsair.Edit (to reply to CS): This obviously isn't my real name, hence you will not find any tickets connected to it. If you so desire this is the ticket ID: 764610That's the phone number we are using: +(31) 036 547 8360Edit #2: Conveniently the RAM is currently out of stock (well, it's been like 4 months now). After all these weeks I have finally got some sort of warranty support from Corsair. They have sent me a check from the US to Europe that can only be full filled at no additional fee at the Bank of America. Closest branch to me? Somewhere in the USA, I suppose. In the era of digital bank transfers, PayPal, store credit I get a check for an American bank in Europe and well, I feel like this is something from before my time.  The even worse thing about it is that the check is in US Dollars (I bought my RAM from an European shop in Euros and the shop is unfortunately out of business) and nope, it's not enough to buy me a new set of the exactly same RAM from their website that Corsair literally stole from me. If I want to full fill the check at any bank here I have to pay a fee that is between 1/3 to a half of the value of the check + the currency conversion fee. Thanks, Corsair, you SUCK. This is not an acceptable ""solution"".EDIT #3: I got no emails received from Corsair requesting ANY bank information. No emails about any such information being requested at their Customer Support portal. No contact about such information being requested via any other channel than their malfunctioning support portal. That is 2,5 months AFTER submitting the ticket, whilst the system automates the tickets to expire after 30 days of no updates according the Netherlands office. For a good while when the ticket number link was clicked in their support portal it would take me to an error page (automated expiration I am guessing). Blank page with one sentence in the top left corner (can't remember the exact wording after so many months). The status of the ticket was that a manager was asked to approve the refund last time I checked (around 1,5 months after submitting the ticket). I stopped using Customer Support Portal after it started giving me errors and there were no changes in the status of ticket. I ended up calling and directly emailing with your local CS in the Netherlands instead. They NEVER requested such information. The web of lies you weaved Corsair is surely an extensive one. I have screenshots to prove exactly everything I have said here. Will add links after Christmas.","Hi,Sorry for all of the trouble, but we did send you multiple emails asking for Bank information so we could do a wire transfer.

I have money, willing to pay...but Corsair just keeps giving me the run around...Terrible...[UPDATE {2} 11-8-2018] 'New' keyboard arrived, I say 'New' as it was a refurbished unit in a refurbished marked box.

""For your concern about the same issue with the replacement I will have this ticket forwarded to our technical support to further assist you."" --REALLY!?? BACK THROUGH THE SAME SYSTEM!?!?! That's when I had enough and called them directly, requesting to speak to a supervisor. It was at this point, after explaining to him these issues, he started to work on it. By the end of the call, I had two pre-paid shipping labels for the defective keyboards (which is actually most likely a software bug, not firmware. Here is my initial request, this, this is why I think it's a software issue:""Currently, when I lock my machine using [WinKey] + ""L"", the keyboard will automatically change to its default settings, which includes the sidelights being 'on'. When I login to Windows, iCue loads my profile to the correct colors, BUT it keeps the sidelights on, when I open the 'Performace' [sic] settings it even shows the ""Enable Sidelightings"" is disabled. I have to toggle it back on, then off to finally turn off the sidelight. I have to do this EVERYTIME I unlock my machine...kind of getting annoying, is there a config file I can force?""This is my initial question, this heavily leans to a software issue, not hardware :/Back to the supervisor at Corsair. He was able to secure a good replacement keyboard and ship it to me in two days. New keyboard is great! BUT, weird...same lighting issue...huh, maybe a software problem? :/So, in the end it took almost two months for a decent resolution. I had to hunt Corsair down and pin them down to get that decent resolution. Clearly, their support system needs some support...AND they still have an irritating software bug.

After numerous calls, online chats, a failed RMA (since I threw the modules away), we got nowhere. The last reply was the worst, as Edward recommended I contact Tech Support and search the Corsair shop for those parts. Simply referencing the entire RMA thread would have shown that I've already been down that road. A thoroughly frustrating experience.

769,"July 01, 2017",1,Svalbard,"Horrible Runaround, lack of leadership, overall bad Company I received a Corsair Void Wireless Headset as a gift a little over a year ago and recently misplaced the dongle for the headset. I contacted customer service June 18th, 2017 in order to utilize my warranty. I went through the entire process sent them my information and paid the $60 for the express shipping. I then received my headset on Monday, June 26th. The next day I shipped out my original headset which cost me $26. After opening the new headset I immediately realized I had been sent the Corsair Void Wired headset, worth half of the original. I contacted Corsair and was told someone would get back to me that day, I did not receive a response. I called on June 27th and was told that I could not receive my correct headset until I again shipped out this wired headset. I called and used chat services over the next few days attempting to speak to a manager and consistently got the ""Runaround"" from the entire staff. It wasn't until Friday, June 30th, that I was promised by one of the staff members that a manager was going to call me ""right now"" that I actually got to speak to someone. Over an hour after I was told this (and no call) I entered the chat room to find out that ""he has taken care of the ticket and does not need to call you."" There was NO update on my ticket. I AGAIN insisted I speak to a manager and was told after he deals with the current customer. I was supposed to be that customer. Finally, another 30 minutes later (still no phone call) I called back into the Customer Service line who informed me the Manager wasn't even available/there. Another lie. He put me on hold and then told me that the manager would be calling me in a minute. Finally. I spoke to a manager. After a few hours, they decided to send me a prepaid label so I could ship back the wired headset and after some more battling, that I could hold onto the wired headset and ship it back later and that they would ship me the new one without receiving the wired one first. I was also promised that this package would be expedited to me. I woke up this morning, Saturday, July 1st, to another message from another staff member stating: ""Hi Evan, I do apologies for the wrong item that was sent in this case for us to work for it and to process the item this will be your new ticket #6947557 kindly send the item back to Corsair we will issue a prepaid label for you not to be charge on the return shipping label. Once we received the item we will send you out your replacement Void Headset. Please allow us 1-2 days to process the pre-paid shipping label. Thanks This staff is BEYOND out of sync. I then realized that I had also received an email indicating that a package had been shipped from Corsair to me, with the estimated delivery date of Thursday, July 6th. Upon searching this I also realized it was NOT expedited. Yet another lie from Corsair customer service. When I contacted them again today I was assured they did not know why it wasn't a higher priority but ""we can find out Monday"" after it has already shipped because there was, AGAIN, no supervisor available. I requested information to the Corporate headquarters and the employee, attempting to get rid of me, gave me the customer service line. This was the final straw. This entire experience has been extremely frustrating, insulting and honestly downright terrible. It is NOT the fault of a customer when a company sends the wrong replacement so it should not be the customer's responsibility to correct the issue.

771,"June 20, 2017",2,Great Britain,"Massively disappointed with Corsair's RMA Service Hello,I wanted to share my experience with the Corsair RMA process... I have found it appalling!I purchased a Corsair Scimitar Mouse in March 2016, I noticed that it had started to double click so I decided to submit a RMA as the mouse was still under warranty with Corsair. I submitted a RMA ticket on 30 May 2017, after the 24 to 48 window had passed I contacted Corsair using live chat and they informed me the RMA was being processed, all necessary information was provided and I would hear back within 24 hours... To which I didn't, so I contacted them again to receive the same message.When I contacted them a third time, they told me that they hadn't received the correct invoice information which is why it had not been processed (I was never told this in the first two times I contacted them and was told everything was fine with my RMA).On the 15 June, I received approval to return my faulty mouse to them at my own discretion (purchasing my own postage). So rather than the usual 24 to 48 hour response Corsair advertise on their website... I had waited 16 days for my RMA to be approved, perhaps longer if I hadn't contacted them myself. One positive in the process is that they sent a replacement and I received it within 24 hours of them receiving my faulty mouse. The only issue was that they sent me the wrong model (yellow version) as my previous model (black version) was no longer in stock, but they had sent me no communication to inform me of this prior to sending it to me. Had they informed me that the black model was out of stock, I would have requested a full refund as I currently have an expensive computer build which a lot of money has been spent to make it look the way it is, a yellow Scimitar Mouse would not fit. (It may seem a small issue, but I do take pride in my build and I am sure others would agree that it can be frustrating to have a piece of hardware that does not match!)I have now requested a full refund and to send the replacement back to them (at my own expense for postage!) and have been given 24 hours to wait yet another response regarding this...

Disappointing, but I accept these things happen. However the RMA procedure has been painful so far. I got a return number very quickly, and the ticket system was easy to use. But then the problems really started.My issues are:1) The package was signed for on Friday morning, but as of Monday evening has yet to even appear on their system. 2) Contact from the UK is difficult. There is no UK number, and the live chat is only available during US hours. Because of this we've lost the entire day.3) The US phone number given is supposedly free via Skype. When I tried, the call failed. It may be an issue on my side, but support only via Skype is a poor effort. How much would it cost a company the size of Corsair to provide a UK number for their UK operation?4) According to a helpful fellow at the end of the support chat, there is apparently a 'discrepancy' at the warehouse - which sounds to me like they've lost it. I am now suffering quite a lot without the use of my PC, but instead of accepting liability and shipping me a replacement, they say they need to resolve the discrepancy before they can proceed.All in all I am disappointed with poor quality of the initial product, poor support for UK customers, and the expectation that I'll sit around without my PC while Corsair sort out problems at their warehouse. It's only been a couple of days, but clearly the infrastructure to support the UK just isn't there.So unfortunately if you're buying from the UK and really need your computer, I suggest looking elsewhere.======== UpdateI managed to get Skype working and was finally able to speak to somebody in the US - this around 3:30pm. She was extremely helpful, and to cut a long story short, to my surprise and delight a replacement arrived the next day. An upgrade from my previous unit as well. Overall, they received the package on Friday morning, and I received a decent replacement on Wednesday. This is not bad at all, so I upgraded my review from 2-3 stars.

I can't share the details of the person who helped but needless to say there are some good people over at Corsair who DO care about customer support and are willing to go the extra mile to help people. Although I haven't received my replacements yet I was satisfied with the resolution they have done - and would be happy to buy from Corsair again. Although I might not have been the most polite person at first it seems that my comments and frustration carried some weight and managed to reach senior people who ""hopefully"" will review and do something about the US based support system which is clearly causing Corsair to lose customer support. I've reviewed back to 4 star now, the issue shouldn't have happened but it did - at least someone was kind enough to take ownership of the issue and help out!################## I've always bought Corsair products based on reviews, quality etc but now after several years of being burnt by products failing and disgraceful customer support - it's time to change. Everything from the best Platinum PSU's (total of 3 replaced), poor case build quality and recently BOTH of my K95 keyboards have dead LED's. Their ""best high end range"" items don't seem to stand up to any usage over time.

FYI this is a space rented at Scan International warehouse. The UK returns is just a waste of time, they don't reply or when they do they take too long and stall for more time. I opened an RMA, several days later it was accepted and the returned item was delivered on the Monday with the promise of 2-3 days for delivery of replacement (FYI they wouldn't allow express replacement). Now over 8 days after the item was actually delivered to the returns place - they still have not shipped a replacement. Kindly offered an upgrade but that still leaves me without my item and are no longer replying to update requests!! I still am yet to return the 2nd keyboard due to the same failure. I'm so annoyed at Corsair, the items are great quality (looking wise) but customer service is such a let down. They shouldn't promote replacement dates / times and not stick to them. It looks like they don't care about the Trust Pilot reviews and others have similar opinions of them, but with any luck if this post saves at least 1 person from buying Corsair products to avoid more problems, then it was worth spending the 5 minutes to write this. I'm not going to promote any other brands because Corsair was always my go-to, now I'm going to have to find someone else!",No Reply,<FreqDist with 8 samples and 9 outcomes>,,0.9963

790,"January 25, 2014",5,Denmark,"Could nok  ask for better costumer service! I purchased a CX430 PSU, which unfortunatly did'nt last longer than 3 weeks, im guessing it must've been faulty from the the beginning, since my computer wasnt running properly, but i managed to request an RMA very easily, and a Corsair-supporter told me, they would take care of shipment back, and forth. The day after i requested my RMA, the faulty PSU was picked up on my adress, is that service or what?! Eventhough the product had to be replaced, i have great confidence in Corsair and their products, and will be looking for their products in the future, simply because of their quality and reliability.",No Reply,<FreqDist with 7 samples and 9 outcomes>,,0.9576
791,"January 03, 2014",5,Great Britain,"The Best! I am not one to support brands usually, I buy things that I like. Corsair however have won me over completely with their top quality products and superb after service. Many of my pc's components are Corsair branded, the power supply, the ram, the case itself and all perform flawlessly. But the Corsair products I enjoy the most however are their peripherals. Corsair are relatively new to this market but that hasn't stopped them going all out on quality and performance. Their M65 mouse is superb, if not a little small for my large hands. And their keyboards are something to behold. I had the K90 which I loved! And now I have the K70 in black and red that just oozes class with it's solid metal construction and beautiful back lights. Where my experience with Corsair has really shined however is their after service. My K90 had a slight fault that some of them experienced, it would repeat itself sometimes when you pressed a key. Not the end of the world and I lived with this for months but finally decided to contact Corsair through their RMA service, they replied within two days and arranged to have my faulty keyboard collected at their expense. A few days later I was pleasantly surprised to be handed a shiny new K95 by the courier. This of course being the updated version of my faulty keyboard, a really nice touch. I had the same experience when my M65 died, Corsair paid for the collection and shipped a brand new one to me in good time. I believe I got lucky with Corsair paying the postage for me and indeed I'd have been annoyed if I'd had to have paid it myself so I hope it is a courtesy they will continue as it goes a long way to ensuring customer satisfaction. This kind of service combined with the quality of their products is just incredible in my eyes, and as long as it continues, I will keep buying Corsair products. Superb company in every regard!!",No Reply,<FreqDist with 8 samples and 10 outcomes>,,0.9956

Had to return my faulty HX850 PSU to Holland! @great postal expense, Corsair claimed it was never returned on there rma returns page, my claim against royal mail for non delivery was rejected after corsair failed to respond to all comminications from royal mail asking for conformation off non delivery!, As well as failing to respond to my own emails i find this company to be a joke and will never buy any more of there faulty products,  Had to give them 1 star in order to rate this company which is far greater than they deserve!

795,"February 17, 2012",5,Great Britain,It's got to have a ship on it! Corsair = Quality. Recent purchase of a CX430 PSU only reinforces the notion...Despite being the entry level unit it's build and aesthetics are perfect. No other PSU brand fills me with such confidence (although Antec and Enermax come close).,No Reply,<FreqDist with 4 samples and 5 outcomes>,,0.7263
